I had been in a car accident when I first walked into Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center and I was pretty bad unable to move my neck. I had hid the emotions I was feeling about the accident which was not helping the situation. I had went for a few weeks and was feeling better emotionally and physically because they knew what I was feeling and going through without me having to tell them and they made me feel ok to feel that way. Unfortunately I wasn't 100% and when I tried to run I felt worse. I use to be a runner so to tell me I now can not do something I've done all my life I was pretty upset. With a few more weeks I was able to get back to where I was prior to the accident and I could not be more thankful to the staff because I know it was only through them that I am able to move on and move forward like if I was never in an accident. So thank you to all who work at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center.
