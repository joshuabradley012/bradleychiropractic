I had suffered with chronic low back pain, neck pain, and frequent headaches for the past 7 years. Before I saw Dr. Bradley, I had relied on muscle relaxants and pain relievers to control the pain. At the time of my first appointment with Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center my low back pain was causing my right leg to cramp and my right foot to go numb. I was having headaches 3-4 times per week and I couldn't even golf! After six weeks of care my pain is virtually gone. I no longer get headaches and now I can even play golf without having pain afterwords or having to take pain medications. The staff is excellent and was always courteous. I would recommend Dr. Bradley and Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center to anyone suffering from unnecessary pain. They are the best!
