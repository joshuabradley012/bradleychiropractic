Dr. Bradley is so amazing. He explained things to me so well when it certainly to my treatment. The massage bed is amazing. His staff, is great. The ladies up front greet me with a smile. The office is nice and clean, and other services his office offers are displayed and readily available. I recommend Dr. Bradley of you are in need of any chiropractic/ physical therapy treatment. They are timely, understanding, and pleasant!!!
