I had suffered with low back pain for several months before seeing Dr. Bradley. I was leaned over to one side and in excruciating pain by the time i got to his office. I just kept thinking the pain would go away, but it just got worse. Before going to his office for chiropractic care I had tried seeing a massage therapist. That gave me temporary relief, at best. With chiropractic care I felt much better by the second visit. After about 6 visits my pain was virtually gone. Now I am back to gardening and an active lifestyle. Not only is my pain gone, but my back feels better than it has in years. I'm able to move with much more flexibility, something I haven't felt in a long time. I would gladly recommend Dr. Bradley and the staff at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center to anyone. They are professional, courteous, and competent at what they do.
