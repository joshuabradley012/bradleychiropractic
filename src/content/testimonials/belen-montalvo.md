Where do I even start. Obviously our first impression was Kelly! She is highly professional and very nice. She made us feel so welcomed every time we walked into the office.

Well I would have to say my experience with Dr. Bradley was extraordinary! I've struggled with chronic back and neck pain for over 10 years. I had back surgery in 2005. Since then I was always afraid to see a chiropractor fearing they might hurt my back. It wasn't until my husband had a serious back injury and began to see Dr. Bradley for his pain that I saw first hand how attentive and caring Dr. Bradley was. I began to receive treatment and immediately after the first session my pain was minimized. I did however feel a little sore after each adjustment, but Dr. Bradley assured me it was normal since I've never been adjusted before. Along with getting weekly treatment, Dr. Bradley offered us a lot of good stretching and strengthening exercises.  Almost two months of treatment and I can finally say that my pain is finally gone.

As for my husband, he was in extreme pain when he first began to see Dr. Bradley. He is now back to normal and has no pain at all.

I can't say this enough, but we are so grateful for Dr. Bradley. Without him my husband and I would most likely still be in a lot of pain. Dr. Bradley is stuck with us for a long time :)
