I would like to start by saying I spent 2 years going to specialist for constant inflammation & muscle spasms and primary care doctor didn't know exactly what was wrong but would always prescribe pain medicine and anti-inflammatory medicine after 2 years I started having stomach issues and constant headaches and always feeling nauseous. One morning I woke up so bad with lock jaw and severe pain in my Rt neck and shoulder and Constant hip pain. I thought I was a lost cause and I was going to spend the rest of my life suffering. I remembered Dr Bradley from a previous visit I had years before and thought iv seen just about every other type of Doctor so I'd give it a try I started seeing Dr Bradley in October 2020 and he set me up with a great plan with a nutrition plan it is December 2020 and I can't believe that all my issues started to resolve. I highly recommend going to see Dr Bradley he hears you out and really invests into your health . Thank you Dr Bradley you helped get me back on track and gave my Kids there mom back!
