Came in for lower back pain. Adjusted me, helped, and guided me with stretches and abdominal workouts to strengthen my lower abs to support my back. Best chiropractor in town. Very professional. Was greeted very kindly by the staff as well. Would recommend him to anyone. Thanks for helping me out Dr. B!
