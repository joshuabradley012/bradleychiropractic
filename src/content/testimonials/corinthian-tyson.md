I have never met a chiropractor as skilled and down to earth as Dr. Bradley. All the ladies at the front desk are so sweet and very professional. Not only have I received treatment from Dr. Bradley, he educated me on how to encourage my body to heal itself outside of his office which, often times, is the missing link between patient and doctor. I felt very comfortable knowing my mother was getting treatment from Dr. Bradley after her car accident. The last thing I'll say is that I really appreciate the love, charisma, and acceptance Dr. Bradley has displayed to me. Upon hearing about my acceptance into chiropractic college he allowed me to shadow behind him as he worked with his patients. I've only known Dr. Bradley for 2 years, but in that, I know he is a great man, great father, great friend, and most of all, a great doctor.
