I had sharp pain in my lower back that would at times hurt so bad it would take my breath away and cause me to fall to the ground. My legs would go numb and I would get excruciating cramps in my calf muscles. I had a constant dull ache in my neck that seemed to never go away and I suffered with headaches that felt like I was being hit in the head with a hammer. I had suffered with this pain for the past 8-10 years, maybe even longer. Before seeing Dr. Bradley I had been to another chiropractor who treated me for about 3 weeks then he gave me a back brace and told me to "be careful." My medical doctors would just give me pain medication. When I told them there was no change they would give a different pill. I started seeing a massage therapist, which was giving me some relief but nothing that would last. When I first walked into Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center, it seemed like they were waiting for me. Dr. Bradley could almost see and feel my pain. He diagnosed my problem and began treatment that day. The staff took care of everything, from the insurance to the scheduling. They were able to accommodate my work schedule and even offered massage therapy as part of my treatment plan (WOW!). I am now able to live without pain and do the things that I enjoy, like throwing a baseball with my son and mowing my lawn. I haven't had any cramps in my legs, and my pain is virtually gone. I am a walking advertisement for Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center. Thank you Dr. Bradley and staff!
