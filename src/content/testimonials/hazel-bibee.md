I had suffered for two months with sciatica that went down my left leg and was causing numbness in my toes. I had been to a medical doctor who had x-rayed my spine and prescribed pain relievers and muscle relaxants. Needless to say they did not help my condition. I normally enjoy being active and working in my garden. Because of the pain, I was unable to do the things that I enjoy. After three weeks of treatment my pain is gone and I am back to gardening. Dr. Bradley and his staff are great and I am so thankful that I found them, I would recommend them to anyone.
