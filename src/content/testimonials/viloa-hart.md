For most of my adult life I had low back pain. It would come and go, and every once in a while it would put me out of commission. 2-3 months before my appointment with Dr. Bradley I began having pain and numbness in my arm. Then my lower back went out on ema again. I couldn't even stand up straight when I first came to the office. I was dropping things because of the numbness i my arms and hands. The pain was wearing my out and slowing me down. In less than 4 weeks of care my low back pain is completely gone and the numbness is subsided to the pint that I hardly notice it. The staff at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center was open, friendly, and willing to help. I appreciated the friendly atmosphere. If someone who had never been to a chiropractor asked me about my experience at Dr. Bradley's office, I would tell them "My fear of chiropractic caused me years suffer years of unnecessary pain." Dr. Bradley and his staff definitely proved me wrong. I wish I had tried chiropractic years ago.
