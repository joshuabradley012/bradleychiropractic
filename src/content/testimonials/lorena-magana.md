I've been going to Dr. Bradley for years now, he's also treated my son for some of his sports injuries and well as his auto accident. He and his staff are always super friendly and are easy to get along with, and I've only ever heard good things coming from friends and the clients that I have referred to him, he is and will continue to be my first choice for chiropractic care for me and for people looking for a chiropractor.
