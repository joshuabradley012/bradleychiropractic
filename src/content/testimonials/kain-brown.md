I was experiencing pain and tension in me neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs. I had also been having numbness and tingling in my hand and arm. The problem had been present for the past 2 to 3 years and was getting worse over time. I had even been to another chiropractor, which hadn't helped. Because of the pain I was not sleeping well at night and I was limited to how much physical work I could perform such as gardening and housework. Dr. Bradley took the time to understand my concerns and was able to pinpoint exactly where the problem was coming from. He set me on a course of regular chiropractic care, therapeutic massage, and specific stretching exercises. I've been impressed by the concern for my pain and the desire to find a remedy that fit my needs. The staff is warm and friendly and treats me like a person. It's a place that I look forward to coming to! To date I have more mobility in my neck, no arm pain, my hip and leg pain has decreased dramatically resulting in better sleep at night and more energy throughout my day. Dr. Bradley takes the time to understand his patient's needs. He was diligent in bringing the relief and care I hoped I would find here.
