I saw the ad in the newspaper about the DRX 9000 and it caught my attention. I had been suffering with severe low back pain and I could hardly walk. I am a self-employed contractor, so I need to have a healthy back. I had been taking prescribed pain pills and had been told to "Take it easy" by my medical doctor. On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain was a 10, I was at my wits end and I didn't know what I was going to do. The x-rays that Dr. Bradley took revealed degenerative disc disease at L5-S1, he scheduled me for an MRI the very next day and once the results were in I was considered a candidate for decompression therapy. This treatment completely got rid of my pain and I have resumed a normal life. I am back to work and more importantly back to golfing. Anyone suffering from debilitating back pain has nothing to lose, but everything to gain. I would highly recommend this therapy.
