I had suffered for ten months with wrist, elbow, back, and neck pain after falling at work. I had been to an orthopedic surgeon who performed an MRI prescribed anti-inflammatories, and pain relievers. I had been to a medical doctor who had x-rayed my spine and prescribed pain relievers and muscles relaxants. Needless to say they did not help my condition. I normally enjoy being active and working in my garden. Because of the pain, I was unable to do the things I enjoy. I was scared and confused with this being a worker's compensation injury. After 3 weeks of treatment my pain is gone and I am back to gardening. Not only did Dr. Bradley give me treatment that helped me get my life back, but his knowledge of how to handle a worker's compensation claim put me at ease. Dr. Bradley and his staff are great and I am so thankful that I found them. I would recommend them to anyone.
