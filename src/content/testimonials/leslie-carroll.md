I went in to Dr.Bradley for my first time ever seeing a Chiropractor. My back was out and I couldn't stand up straight. I went in on a Wed morning with big plans out of town that weekend.  He recommended I come Thurs and Fri before I left town. By Friday morning I was standing up straight, walking normal and felt amazing. I have no idea how but he works miracles. Highly recommend Dr. Bradley. He makes you comfortable.
