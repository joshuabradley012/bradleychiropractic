I have had two back surgeries and a series of epidural injections for a disc protrusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1. For a while my back felt better, but slowly the pain started to return. i didn't want to get another surgery and I wasn't very excited about another epidural injection. I was in from out of town for a few weeks and saw an ad in the newspaper for the DRX 9000. It looked interesting so I called the office for a consultation. After the first treatment my sciatic pain significantly decreased. I was only able to go through 5 sessions, but I had fantastic results. My pain levels were almost completely gone within 5 sessions. I was referred to a doctor in Denver who has a DRX 9000 so that I can continue with my treatment. I would highly advise the DRX 9000 for anyone suffering with low back pain who doesn't want to go through surgery, especially if they have already gone through it twice.
