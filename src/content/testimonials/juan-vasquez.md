Dr. Bradley is the best!  He helped me lose weight which helped me get rid of my high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and stress! Dr. B wants his patient's to have positive outcomes, I am a living example! He taught me how to eat better to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He is very knowledgeable about health. He is seriously the best Chiropractor. Bakersfield is lucky to have him. He is also a great personal trainer. He will show you how to exercise and lift weights properly so you don't hurt your spine. His staff is amazing too!
