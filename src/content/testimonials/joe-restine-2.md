I had suffered with low back pain for many years. Approximately 2 years ago the pain became so severe, that i sought the advice of an orthopedic surgeon. After receiving a series of 3 epidural injections and still not getting any relief, I was told that the only thing that would help was surgery. During that time I tried several other chiropractors and still did not receive any relief. When I saw the ad in the paper for the DRX 9000, I made an appointment for a consultation. As soon as I saw the table it just made sense and I was excited to get started. I was out of options and I didn't want surgery. After 15 treatments on the DRX 9000 I am pain free. This table is a miracle.
