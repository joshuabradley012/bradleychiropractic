Two thumbs up service! Literally the best chiropractor in town. Dr. B goes above and beyond. I have been to other chiropractors before but none compare to him. You get a good Dr. and good staff. Dr. B is passionate about his work and it shows. He and his team do an amazing job! When it comes to anything to do with joints, ligaments, bones and eating, I trust Dr. B over my own MD. I was misdiagnosed by my doctor who said I had a rotator cuff injury. Dr. B examined me properly to find out it was a sub-scapular injury instead. He treated me and within weeks, my pain stated to subside and I started feeling better. In addition, he showed me things to do at home to help with the healing process. Thank you Dr. Bradley and staff! I know it only allows to do 5 stars he deserves 10 in my opinion.
