After helping my wife with her arm pain, I thought I'd give Dr. Bradley a try as well. I've been to 18 doctors and therapists over the past 7 years for my persistent hip pain. Dr. Bradley listened to my story and got a fix on my problem after our very first consultation. It's going to take time and effort but I think I'm finally on the road to recovery. Thank you, Dr. B!
