I had suffered from headaches, TMJ (jaw) pain, neck pain and stiffness for 4 and a half years. My pain began following a work related injury. I had been to many doctors, including a pain management specialist, and even a chiropractor. the pain management specialist had given me cortisone injections and prescribed me Vicodin and Soma. The chiropractor that I saw prior to seeing Dr. Bradley had adjusted my neck, but I only felt worse.

My husband had seen an ad in the newspaper that Dr. Bradley had ran and he scheduled an appointment for me. Needless to say, I was skeptical. I had already tried chiropractic and it hadn't helped. I had reached a point of deciding that I was just going to have to live in pain. With Dr. Bradley's care I am happy to say that I am pain free. I am a new me! I no longer have headaches and I'm able to do physical activity that I had been unable to do for a long time. "Would I recommend the Doctors at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center?" Yes! Yes! Yes!
