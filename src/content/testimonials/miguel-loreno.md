Dr. Bradley and his staff are such a great help!! I was having really bad back pain. I could barley get out of bed in the mornings. Within 2 adjustments, I was able to work normally at work (mechanic) and at home with minimal discomfort. I highly recommend everyone  to come here for any back issues. Him and his staff are honest and trustworthy.
