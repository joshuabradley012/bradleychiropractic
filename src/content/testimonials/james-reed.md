I had suffered from low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, and numbness in my left leg for the past 2 to 3 years. I just figured it was due to old age and didn't know if anything could be done to help. I was treated with the utmost respect by the staff at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center. I was well informed about what the findings were on my exam and what it would take to fix the problem. I am happy to report that I have had a drastic reduction in pain. I was able to shop firewood without having any low back pain which was wonderful! The atmosphere at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center is always friendly and my appointments were always on time. I would highly recommend Dr. Bradley and the staff at Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center.
