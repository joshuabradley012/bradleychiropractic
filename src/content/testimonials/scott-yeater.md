I recently moved and I knew I needed a new chiropractor. After researching who had the types of therapies I was interested I made an appointment. Dr Bradley found an issue without my telling him which was my lower back. I purchased a package and Decompression plus adjustments took care of a pain I had for years. Dr Bradley really impressed me with his enthusiasm for corrective exercise's and nutrition. So I highly recommend this office. When you go you will meet Kelly (Front Desk) who is always professional and willing to help you. Then I found a great Massage Therapist Janette, cant wait to go back to see her. Prices are really good. If your reading this and thinking about your chiropractic, its worth it! You shouldn't skimp out on your own healthcare.
