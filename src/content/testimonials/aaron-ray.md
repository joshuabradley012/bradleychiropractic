I went in for lower back pain within a couple of appointments my lower back pain was gone! What was amazing was he also gave me workouts to do at home to strengthen it and increase flexibility. My back is now stronger then ever and I am able to go farther in my workouts! Highly recommend to anybody but especially if your an athlete.
