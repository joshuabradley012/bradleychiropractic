I was referred to Dr. Bradley by a friend after I was in a car accident. I had never been to a Chiropractor and was not only worried about the pains I was having but was worried about what an “adjustment” involved. Dr. Bradley answered my questions, explained the process and put me at ease. After every appointment with Dr Bradley, and with the massage therapist, I left feeling less pain until one day I had no more head, neck or back pain and was finally able to sleep through the night! I am so grateful to Dr. Bradley, Jeanette, Mary, Veronica and all the staff who treated me with such expertise, kindness and patience!
