I believe in maintaining good health through chiropractic care. I have been seeing chiropractors for years. I relocated to Bakersfield and sought a doctor of chiropractic my first week here. I have had a history of sinus problems and headaches that had been controlled through chiropractic care, so I wanted to make sure I avoided those problems when moving here. I am happy to say that since moving her I haven't had any migraine headaches, and minimal sinus discomfort. Dr. Bradley and his staff have treated me excellently! When given the opportunity to tell others about chiropractic care, and more specifically about Dr. Bradley's care I always tell them "What are you waiting for?"
