Dr. Bradley is a wonderful chiropractor!  I have been to many chiropractors over the years and always had the same experience: a two minute adjustment and a boot out the door. Dr. Bradley actually asks me how I'm feeling, where the pain is and then will treat me with stretches, an adjustment and often gives me exercises to do at home!  My back pain that I had for two years is almost completely gone.  I highly recommend Dr Bradley's chiropractic office.
