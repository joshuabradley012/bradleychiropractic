Besides being greeted with encouraging words each visit, Dr. Bradley, Joshua and the entire staff at Bradley Chiropractic, make sure patients are cared for with compassion and professionalism. Iâ€™m so grateful Dr. Bradley has taken the guess work out of  knowing nutritionally, what I'm lacking in and how much I need to take of vitamins and supplements, to be nourished and energetic, while not over taxing or not providing the nutrients I personally need. I am so please with the nutritional counsel available through Dr. Bradley.

In addition, Joshua Bradley is a Check Exercise Coach. He sees his clients in a completely equipped work out studio. With the use of the Check Exercise Coach program, Joshua has tailored a stability and balance exercise program for me, targeting posture, breathing, and deep core weaknesses. This approach to achieving proper alignment has caused me to become stronger, pain free in my knees, shoulders, hips and ankles. My posture and improved abdominal breathing have dramatically improved.

Since becoming a patient/client of Bradley Chiropractic and Nutritional Center, I am achieving my 2016 goals for increased health, fitness and inner strength.
