2012 I was working as an ICU/CCU nurse in one of the hospitals here in Bakersfield when I hurt my back. My Orthopedic surgeon Doctor did all the PT recommendations and for 6 months - it only alleviated the pain a little. I had to go back to work bec my leave was over, he sent me to Dr Bradley. At first, I was very skeptical bec I've heard so much stories about chiro treatment. But in two weeks, just "2 weeks" I was back on my feet again!!! Moving and running around like nothing happened! I was recovering heart bypass surgeries again.

Dr. Bradley, he is my miracle worker!!! He had been my generous guide and healer, that I can keep working as a nurse because of him - pain free!!! He has the kindest heart, he treats everybody as equal and has a genuine interest of his patients. He has a very gentle blessed touch that guides the alinement of all his patients. He listens to all the complaints of his patients and always has us all relaxed and fell very important. I agree with my orthopedic MD about Dr Bradley - that he has gifted hands. He always goes above and beyond the call of duty, he treat you where you hurt like it was his own pain - he knows where it is always.

He is so good, that even if he's not cover by my insurance, I keep coming back. I would "never" let any chiropractor touch my back. May you always be well and healthy, and blessed Dr Bradley!!!

Thank you so much Dr Bradley!!!
