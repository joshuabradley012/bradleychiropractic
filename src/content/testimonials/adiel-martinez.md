Dr. Brendon has a great personality, takes time with patients, with out rushing through like I have experience with other clinics, Dr. Brendon has good experience on body stucture to rely on his treatment. His staff are also very personable, and treat people with care, and are allways smiling. That is just part of the experience we have had and it only been aour first visit. I can continue to give feed back on future visits that are to be scheduled every monday for the next possible two months.
