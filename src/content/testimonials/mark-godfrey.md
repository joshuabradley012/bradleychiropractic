Dr. Bradley and his staff are most friendly and efficient. Dr. Bradley is able to get my back and neck "in" where other chiropractors have not. Although I am in Arizona now I do come to Bakersfield every month or two and I always come in to see Dr. Bradley when I am there and leave in better shape.
