### What should I expect on a first visit?

On your first visit a thorough consultation of your health complaint will be taken. You will fill out a detailed health history questionnaire and if you decide to go with our unique approach you will be provided with the requisition form to take to the lab for blood work. Depending on your particular health problems you may also be requested to do a hair analysis, this is a take home test kit (all details will be completely explained).

### What can it help?

Nutritional imbalances and deficiencies are a big part of why people are unhealthy in today's world. When a comprehensive whole body approach is taken, the body shows an amazing ability to heal. Almost any disease process can be reversed with proper nutrition and a whole body approach to health. Of course there are certain disease processes where medical intervention is absolutely necessary and if we detect any serious disease processes through your laboratory testing we will refer you to an appropriate medical specialist.

### How does it help?

We use a detailed blood test to evaluate the overall health of your body. Often times we can catch imbalances in your physiology before a disease process sets in. By making specific nutritional recommendations off the results of your blood and other laboratory tests we are able to objectively measure your response to our recommendations. Once we have all of the results of your tests, we will provide you with a 90 day plan of specific diet and nutritional protocols to follow. After the 90 days re-testing will be performed to monitor your progress.

### What type of results can I expect?

By bringing the body into a state of optimal physiological health your body has all of the materials it needs to heal and maintain a state of health.

### How long does the nutrition plan last?

We usually place patients on 90 protocols and re-test to determine future needs. Keep in mind that some cases are unique and we may take a different approach in needed.

### Do I have to keep doing it?

The beauty of using laboratory testing to determine a person's nutritional needs is that you only end up taking the nutritional supplements that your body truly needs. It takes the guess work out of nutrition.

### Will I be placed on a specific diet?

Yes, in most cases. But it is still up to you to follow it, we can only give recommendations.

### Do I have to give up eating what I like?

If you like real food that is healthy and nutritious for you, than no. If you live on fast food and processed food, than yes.

### How much does it cost?

Our initial consultation for nutritional analysis is $150. The lab testing and cost of supplements varies with your particular needs. All costs will be explained to you up front after a plan has been set following your consultation.
