### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a free consultation to determine whether or not you are a candidate for non-surgical spinal decompression. During this visit a complete review of your history and symptoms will be discussed. You will have a full understanding of what non-surgical spinal decompression is and how it works. You will also be given a demonstration of the DRX-9000. If x-rays or an MRI have already been performed, Dr. Bradley will review them. If they have not been done, recommendations will be made accordingly.

### What can it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression with the DRX-9000 is an excellent treatment option for herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, nerve root compression, spinal stenosis, facet syndrome, degenerative arthritis and many other forms of chronic lower back pain.

### How does it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression utilizes state of the art technology that stretches a specified segment of your spine. This gentle stretch is done in such a way as to not create what is known as muscle guarding or spasm. By keeping the muscles that surround your spine relaxed the stretch is able to decompress the specified spinal disc and vertebral area and create a negative pressure in the disc. When disc herniations are present, this decompressive force draws the bulging material back to the center of the disc where it should be, thus alleviating the pressure on the nerve and/or spinal cord structures. Once this pressure is removed, pain is eliminated and your spine can begin to heal and be properly rehabilitated.

### Is it painful?

When a patient is in a significant amount of pain they may not get any appreciable relief at first. But, usually by the third visit, pain levels begin to significantly decrease. The treatment itself is not painful and in fact it feels good. Many of our patients fall asleep while on the table because they are finally getting some relief of their pain.

### Is it covered by insurance?

Non-surgical spinal decompression is not a covered service under health insurance plans. Some clinics may lead patients to believe this to be a covered service, but they are either billing for other services rendered on the same visit or they are using questionable billing practices. Our service is a cash based procedure. Once it has been determined whether or not you are a candidate a complete care plan with pricing will be reviewed with you with payment options.

### Can it help me?

We have been helping people with non-surgical spinal decompression using the DRX-9000 since 2004. We have helped thousands of people get out of pain and get their lives back. They have been able to get off of powerful prescription drugs and avoid surgery. We take great care in determining whether or not a patient qualifies for care. By taking these measures we are able to give our patients the best chance possible of getting well. Obviously we can't help every single person that comes in, but when we review a case that is beyond our abilities we will make sure to refer you our to a specialist who can offer you some viable options.

### How many sessions will I need?

The average treatment plan is 20 visits over a 6 week period. Some cases are different and may require more or sometimes less treatment.

### What does a typical treatment plan look like?

A typical treatment plan consists of 5 visits per week for the first 2 weeks, 3 times per week for the next two weeks and finally two visits per week for the final two weeks.

### Is it expensive?

We have care plans ranging from $2500 to $6000 depending on one's needs.
