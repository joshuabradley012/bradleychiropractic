### Degenerative Disc

The discs in your spine stay healthy through movement. Injury often causes a lack of movement around the discs due to muscle spasms and guarding. This lack of movement causes the discs to essentially dry out of dehydrate. The medical term for a disc that is losing its hydration and drying out is "desiccation". The gentle pull placed upon the spine during decompression causes movement around the disc helping rehydrate it and become more viable, thereby allowing better movement and less pain.

### Bulging (Herniated) Disc

A normal healthy disc is hydrated and sponge like. Think of an intervertebral disc like a jelly donut. The middle of the disc, or nucleus pulposus, is a jelly like material and the outer fibers, known as the annular fibrosis hold the jelly like material within the center of the disc. Through direct or repetitive injury the outer fibers begin to weaken and in some instances tear, allowing the jelly like material to bulge outward. Frequently, the bulging part of the disc places pressure on the exiting nerve root, causing severe pain into the leg. Decompression creates a negative pressure around the disc allowing the bulge to centralize and heal, thus the pressure on the nerve root is removed and the pain relieved.

### Facet Syndrome

Between the vertebral bodies and behind the disc is a pair of joints called facet joints. This is where the majority of motion occurs as we move our spines. When there is less height between the vertebrae due to disc degeneration, the facet joints are under more pressure thereby causing inflammation of the joint capsule and pain. Over time degeneration can also occur between the facet joints. Decompression therapy creates a gentle distraction between these joints, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.

### Sciatica

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve that runs down your leg. It is made up of the L4 and L5 nerve roots and their branches. When these nerve roots are compressed, either due to disc herniation or degenerative changes, they cause severe pain throughout the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Decompression therapy effectively treats sciatica by reducing the bulging or degenerative disc putting pressure on the nerve roots.

### Failed Back Surgery

Not all back surgery is successful and in some instances decompression therapy can offer relief even to those who have already undergone surgery. However, there are some candidates who donâ€™t qualify for decompression therapy. A thorough history and examination is performed before accepting a patient, to ensure they are a good candidate for this particular treatment.

### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a free consultation to determine whether or not you are a candidate for non-surgical spinal decompression. During this visit a complete review of your history and symptoms will be discussed. You will have a full understanding of what non-surgical spinal decompression is and how it works. You will also be given a demonstration of the DRX-9000. If x-rays or an MRI have already been performed, Dr. Bradley will review them. If they have not been done, recommendations will be made accordingly.

### What can it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression with the DRX-9000 is an excellent treatment option for herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, nerve root compression, spinal stenosis, facet syndrome, degenerative arthritis and many other forms of chronic lower back pain.

### How does it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression utilizes state of the art technology that stretches a specified segment of your spine. This gentle stretch is done in such a way as to not create what is known as muscle guarding or spasm. By keeping the muscles that surround your spine relaxed the stretch is able to decompress the specified spinal disc and vertebral area and create a negative pressure in the disc. When disc herniations are present, this decompressive force draws the bulging material back to the center of the disc where it should be, thus alleviating the pressure on the nerve and/or spinal cord structures. Once this pressure is removed, pain is eliminated and your spine can begin to heal and be properly rehabilitated.

### Is it painful?

When a patient is in a significant amount of pain they may not get any appreciable relief at first. But, usually by the third visit, pain levels begin to significantly decrease. The treatment itself is not painful and in fact it feels good. Many of our patients fall asleep while on the table because they are finally getting some relief of their pain.

### Is it covered by insurance?

Non-surgical spinal decompression is not a covered service under health insurance plans. Some clinics may lead patients to believe this to be a covered service, but they are either billing for other services rendered on the same visit or they are using questionable billing practices. Our service is a cash based procedure. Once it has been determined whether or not you are a candidate a complete care plan with pricing will be reviewed with you with payment options.

### Can it help me?

We have been helping people with non-surgical spinal decompression using the DRX-9000 since 2004. We have helped thousands of people get out of pain and get their lives back. They have been able to get off of powerful prescription drugs and avoid surgery. We take great care in determining whether or not a patient qualifies for care. By taking these measures we are able to give our patients the best chance possible of getting well. Obviously we can't help every single person that comes in, but when we review a case that is beyond our abilities we will make sure to refer you our to a specialist who can offer you some viable options.

### How many sessions will I need?

The average treatment plan is 20 visits over a 6 week period. Some cases are different and may require more or sometimes less treatment.

### What does a typical treatment plan look like?

A typical treatment plan consists of 5 visits per week for the first 2 weeks, 3 times per week for the next two weeks and finally two visits per week for the final two weeks.

### Is it expensive?

We have care plans ranging from $2500 to $6000 depending on one's needs.
