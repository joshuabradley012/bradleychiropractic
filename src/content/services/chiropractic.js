### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a thorough face to face consultation of your complaints  and concerns followed by a physical examination. If x-rays or other imaging studies are necessary they will be performed. The information gathered from the consultation, exam findings, and imaging studies (if needed) will be analyzed to create an appropriate treatment plan suited to your specific needs.

### What can it help?

Chiropractic is a treatment that focuses on the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems. Some of the common things that are effectively treated are headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand pain, arthritis, thoracic pain, rib pain, lower back pain, sciatica, hip pain and dysfunction, knee pain, tendinitis, foot and ankle pain, etc. Also, because chiropractic has a positive effect on balancing the nervous system there are other conditions that can also be helped, such as, digestive complaints, fibromyalgia, lupus, sleep disorders, colic in infants, etc.

### How does it help?

Chiropractic helps by balancing your musculoskeletal and nervous system through a specific hands on technique called "adjustments".

### Is chiropractic painful?

Many  patients are in a lot of pain when first coming to our office. We use a combination of therapies similar to a physical therapist to help decrease pain. Once the muscles are relaxed it makes the adjustment much more comfortable. The adjustment itself may be scary to many first time chiropractic patients but is never painful.

### Are x-rays needed?

Every case is different because every patient is unique. Not all patients require x-rays. If you have a problem that can be better treated or diagnosed through x-rays, then they will most likely be recommended.

### How many times do I have to go?

Every case is unique. Once a consultation, and examination have been performed. Dr. Bradley will come up with a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Some people only need a couple of treatments and others need more.

### Will I have to keep going?

One of the most common misconceptions about chiropractic is that many people believe that once you go to a chiropractor you will have to go the rest of your life. This just simply isn't true. Those who choose to make chiropractic part of a regular routine in order to maintain a desired level of health may come in for care on a regular basis. Others may only use chiropractic to get symptomatic relief. The choice is entirely up to you.

### Is chiropractic dangerous?

Chiropractic is among the safest forms of healthcare available. It is an all natural, holistically based healthcare treatment. Many people are able to avoid unnecessary drugs and surgery as a result of chiropractic treatment.

### What is happening when a joint "pops"?

When two smooth surfaces are in contact, such as is the case with spinal and peripheral joints, these surfaces can lose their normal range of motion due to misalignment and pressure from muscular imbalance or tension. Chiropractic adjustments help restore proper movement between these joint surfaces. When a joint that is fixated or out alignment is "adjusted" the two surfaces that make up a joint are rapidly moved away from each other. This movement causes what is known as cavitation, causing air or gas to release between the two surfaces. As cavitation occurs a "popping sound" is released.
