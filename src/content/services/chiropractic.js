### Headaches

Most headaches are caused by tension within the muscles and joints of the upper back and neck. Tension is caused by poor posture and misalignment of the vertebrae within the spine. These misalignments are called subluxations. Chiropractors are uniquely qualified to locate, detect and remove subluxations. By removing subluxations, the body is more balanced. Pain and tension are relived and in most cases symptoms such as headaches disappear. Chiropractic is a safe and effective treatment for headaches.

### Neck Pain

Neck pain has become a common occurrence in modern society. Because of cell phones and computers we are constantly looking down (flexing our necks). Over time this repetitive flexion causes postural imbalances leading to pain and dysfunction. A common postural finding with our patientâ€™s is forward head posture coupled with upper crossed syndrome. When these imbalances are present, the vertebrae in our necks become misaligned and stuck or fixated. By correcting the postural imbalances and restoring proper movement to the neck, chiropractic effectively treats these common causes of neck pain.

### Low Back Pain

Statistics tell us that 80% of all people with experience lower back pain at some point in their life. The low back consists of 5 bones (vertebrae) with discs in between acting as shock absorbers. Between each vertebra are spaces where the spinal nerves exit. When injury occurs to the spine, vertebrae become misaligned, discs often injured and spinal nerves compressed. Many people suffering from low back pain benefit greatly from chiropractic care. Chiropractic care is safe, effective and affordable, especially when compared to drugs and surgery.

### Sciatica

When a disc bulges or (herniates) it can put pressure on the nerves that exit your spine and travel down your leg. This is called sciatica. After a detailed history, examination and evaluation of x-rays and MRI we can determine the best course of care for those suffering from sciatica. In some cases, a conservative course of chiropractic care is all that is needed. If the disc herniation is more pronounced, spinal decompression might be the best way to go. In rare situations, the disc herniation is too large and a referral will be made to either a pain management specialist or an orthopedic surgeon.

### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

One of the nerves that travel down the front part of your arm into your hand is called the median nerve. When this nerve becomes compressed it causes pain, numbness and tingling and inflammation in your hand. The median nerve originates from branches of the nerves that exit your neck. By combining chiropractic care along with specific exercises and muscle release techniques we are able to treat many people with carpal tunnel syndrome. When treatment is successful, a person is able to avoid surgery and long periods of recovery and get back to their normal routine.

### Shoulder Pain

Because postural imbalances are prevalent in our society and due to the complexity of the shoulder joint, injuries and conditions of the shoulder are a very common in our office. The nerves that supply the muscles of the shoulder exit the lower part of the neck. Poor posture lends itself to placing increased stress on the muscles within the shoulder that make up the rotator cuff tendon. We have a specific protocol of exercises, chiropractic adjustments and muscular release techniques that we use to effectively treat those suffering from shoulder pain.

### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a thorough face to face consultation of your complaints  and concerns followed by a physical examination. If x-rays or other imaging studies are necessary they will be performed. The information gathered from the consultation, exam findings, and imaging studies (if needed) will be analyzed to create an appropriate treatment plan suited to your specific needs.

### What can it help?

Chiropractic is a treatment that focuses on the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems. Some of the common things that are effectively treated are headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand pain, arthritis, thoracic pain, rib pain, lower back pain, sciatica, hip pain and dysfunction, knee pain, tendinitis, foot and ankle pain, etc. Also, because chiropractic has a positive effect on balancing the nervous system there are other conditions that can also be helped, such as, digestive complaints, fibromyalgia, lupus, sleep disorders, colic in infants, etc.

### How does it help?

Chiropractic helps by balancing your musculoskeletal and nervous system through a specific hands on technique called "adjustments".

### Is chiropractic painful?

Many  patients are in a lot of pain when first coming to our office. We use a combination of therapies similar to a physical therapist to help decrease pain. Once the muscles are relaxed it makes the adjustment much more comfortable. The adjustment itself may be scary to many first time chiropractic patients but is never painful.

### Are x-rays needed?

Every case is different because every patient is unique. Not all patients require x-rays. If you have a problem that can be better treated or diagnosed through x-rays, then they will most likely be recommended.

### How many times do I have to go?

Every case is unique. Once a consultation, and examination have been performed. Dr. Bradley will come up with a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Some people only need a couple of treatments and others need more.

### Will I have to keep going?

One of the most common misconceptions about chiropractic is that many people believe that once you go to a chiropractor you will have to go the rest of your life. This just simply isn't true. Those who choose to make chiropractic part of a regular routine in order to maintain a desired level of health may come in for care on a regular basis. Others may only use chiropractic to get symptomatic relief. The choice is entirely up to you.

### Is chiropractic dangerous?

Chiropractic is among the safest forms of healthcare available. It is an all natural, holistically based healthcare treatment. Many people are able to avoid unnecessary drugs and surgery as a result of chiropractic treatment.

### What is happening when a joint "pops"?

When two smooth surfaces are in contact, such as is the case with spinal and peripheral joints, these surfaces can lose their normal range of motion due to misalignment and pressure from muscular imbalance or tension. Chiropractic adjustments help restore proper movement between these joint surfaces. When a joint that is fixated or out alignment is "adjusted" the two surfaces that make up a joint are rapidly moved away from each other. This movement causes what is known as cavitation, causing air or gas to release between the two surfaces. As cavitation occurs a "popping sound" is released.
