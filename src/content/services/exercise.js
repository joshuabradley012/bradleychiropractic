### Upper Crossed Syndrome

Poor posture over a period of time can cause permanent changes to the muscles and skeleton. Sitting is the most common cause of a postural imbalance known as upper crossed syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a wounded mid thoracic spine, a forward head and forwardly rounded shoulders. Within the posterior aspect of the spine, the lower and middle trapezius muscles become stretched and weakened. The upper trapezius, levator scapulae and sub- occipital muscles become tight and short. In the front aspect of the body the pectoral muscles and anterior deltoids become short and tight. While the deep cervical flexors become elongated and weak. It is important to properly evaluate an individual and recognize these imbalances so that a proper exercise routine can be recommended. One that focuses on stretching the short muscles and strengthening the long, weak muscles is very important.

### Lower Crossed Syndrome

This is a postural imbalance of the lower part of the body, involving the lower back and pelvis. It is characterized by an anteriorly tilted pelvis with weak abdominal muscles, weak gluteal muscles and tight hip flexors, hamstrings and lower back muscles. This syndrome is a common finding is those suffering from chronic lower back pain. Many people are unaware they have imbalances such as this and often are exercising in a manner that perpetuates the imbalance. Having said that, it is very important that the proper stretching and strengthening exercises are given so that these imbalances can be corrected.

### Forward Head Posture

While forward head posture is a part of upper crossed syndrome, it can also exist in and of itself. It is a very common finding, due to our fixation on cell phones and computers. Many people with headaches and chronic neck and upper back pain have forward head posture. There are a specific set of exercises involving stretching, mobilization and strengthening. When they are done properly, forward head posture can be corrected over time.

### Weak Core Muscles

The abdominal wall (often referred to as the Core) is very often dysfunctional in many people. Most of these people are unaware of the imbalance and/or weaknesses they may have. In some cases, people who regularly train their (Core) are doing exercises that are actually causing further weakness and dysfunction of the abdominal muscles. We have a specific way of assessing core strength and identifying any underlying weakness or dysfunction. Once these imbalances are identified they can be properly corrected by doing the proper sequence of exercises.

### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a comprehensive musculoskeletal and postural evaluation. The findings from this evaluation will let us know what postural and muscular balances are present. All of this information will allow us to put together a specific corrective exercise routine tailored to your unique needs.

### What can it help?

Whether you are struggling with chronic pain, injuries that don't seem to ever go away or just want to learn how to train at peak levels, this approach can help you.

### How does it help?

Most people have been greatly misled when it comes to exercise. In fact most people have no idea how to perform an exercise properly nor do they really know what exercises they should specifically be doing to improve their weaknesses or imbalances. Because of this lack of information many people are actually hurting rather than helping themselves when they exercise. With the knowledge you will gain from this approach you will be able to take your physical well being to another level.

### What type of results can I expect?

You will be able to expect results that you've never experienced before by applying the knowledge you will gain with this approach. You will exercise and feel better than through most other methods because you will be balancing your body and exercising to target your unique needs.

### What if have no experience exercising?

It is actually much easier to work with someone with no prior exercise experience, because they have not developed bad habits and incorrect ideology concerning exercise.

### What if I already exercise on my own?

We offer two different avenues for our clients. Once an evaluation has been performed and a program built, the client has two choices, they can perform the exercises in our facility, with one on one attention, insuring proper form and execution. They can continue to use our facility or once they have learned how to perform each exercise properly and have a complete understanding of what to do and how to do it, they can choose to exercise on their own.

### How many sessions is it?

We offer a variety of packages based on the findings of the evaluation and the needs of the client. Programs are generally written with a 4 to 6 week period. After the initial period a re-evaluation is performed to determine any changes to the exercise program that may be necessary.

### Do I have to keep doing it?

Obviously exercise is something that everyone should be doing at one level or another. Our goal is to educate our clients so that they exercise in a manner that is appropriate for their unique needs and goals.

### How much does it cost?

Our initial consultation and examination is $100.00. Once a program has been designed, we have a variety of packages available to offer our clients.
