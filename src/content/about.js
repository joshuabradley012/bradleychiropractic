  headline: 'About Dr. Bradley',
  text: `
Dr. Bradley has been a practicing chiropractor for the past 20 years, the last 19 of those were spent here in Bakersfield, CA. He attended the University of San Diego for his undergraduate degree and then went on to Southern California University of Health Sciences completing his Doctorate of Chiropractic in 1995.

With a passion for health, Dr. Bradley has spent many hours expanding his knowledge beyond his education. Using what he learns he helps people achieve a higher level of health through chiropractic, exercise, diet, and nutrition.

As part of his self-education, Dr. Bradley has earned several certifications to master what he learns. He is a C.H.E.K Exercise Coach, a functional diagnostic nutritionist (FDN), and is partnered with Science Based Nutrition.

As a C.H.E.K Exercise coach, Dr. Bradley has an extensive knowledge of rehabilitative exercises and how to correctly train someone to perform them. This certification has also broadened his overall knowledge of holistic health as there is a heavy focus on the nutritional and mental/emotional aspects of health. Every part of your being must be considered when looking to improve your health.

Science Based Nutrition is a company that uses samples and laboratory testing to create a targeted nutritional plan to serve each patient's unique needs. The laboratory testing takes blood samples (and whatever other necessary samples) to analyze the nutritional content and breakdown the information into an actionable report. The report is full of indicators for possible health complications that can arise, diet tips on how to eat better for your specific needs, and a list of supplements you can take to actively improve your most troubled areas.

These skills, in combination with chiropractic, make it possible for Dr. Bradley to fully treat each patient. He can get you on the road to better health where you are vibrant, pain free, and able to live your dream.

### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a thorough face to face consultation of your complaints  and concerns followed by a physical examination. If x-rays or other imaging studies are necessary they will be performed. The information gathered from the consultation, exam findings, and imaging studies (if needed) will be analyzed to create an appropriate treatment plan suited to your specific needs.

### What can it help?

Chiropractic is a treatment that focuses on the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems. Some of the common things that are effectively treated are headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand pain, arthritis, thoracic pain, rib pain, lower back pain, sciatica, hip pain and dysfunction, knee pain, tendinitis, foot and ankle pain, etc. Also, because chiropractic has a positive effect on balancing the nervous system there are other conditions that can also be helped, such as, digestive complaints, fibromyalgia, lupus, sleep disorders, colic in infants, etc.

### How does it help?

Chiropractic helps by balancing your musculoskeletal and nervous system through a specific hands on technique called "adjustments".

### Is chiropractic painful?

Many  patients are in a lot of pain when first coming to our office. We use a combination of therapies similar to a physical therapist to help decrease pain. Once the muscles are relaxed it makes the adjustment much more comfortable. The adjustment itself may be scary to many first time chiropractic patients but is never painful.

### Are x-rays needed?

Every case is different because every patient is unique. Not all patients require x-rays. If you have a problem that can be better treated or diagnosed through x-rays, then they will most likely be recommended.

### How many times do I have to go?

Every case is unique. Once a consultation, and examination have been performed. Dr. Bradley will come up with a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Some people only need a couple of treatments and others need more.

### Will I have to keep going?

One of the most common misconceptions about chiropractic is that many people believe that once you go to a chiropractor you will have to go the rest of your life. This just simply isn't true. Those who choose to make chiropractic part of a regular routine in order to maintain a desired level of health may come in for care on a regular basis. Others may only use chiropractic to get symptomatic relief. The choice is entirely up to you.

### Is chiropractic dangerous?

Chiropractic is among the safest forms of healthcare available. It is an all natural, holistically based healthcare treatment. Many people are able to avoid unnecessary drugs and surgery as a result of chiropractic treatment.

### What is happening when a joint "pops"?

When two smooth surfaces are in contact, such as is the case with spinal and peripheral joints, these surfaces can lose their normal range of motion due to misalignment and pressure from muscular imbalance or tension. Chiropractic adjustments help restore proper movement between these joint surfaces. When a joint that is fixated or out alignment is "adjusted" the two surfaces that make up a joint are rapidly moved away from each other. This movement causes what is known as cavitation, causing air or gas to release between the two surfaces. As cavitation occurs a "popping sound" is released.

### What should I expect on a first visit?

Your first visit will consist of a free consultation to determine whether or not you are a candidate for non-surgical spinal decompression. During this visit a complete review of your history and symptoms will be discussed. You will have a full understanding of what non-surgical spinal decompression is and how it works. You will also be given a demonstration of the DRX-9000. If x-rays or an MRI have already been performed, Dr. Bradley will review them. If they have not been done, recommendations will be made accordingly.

### What can it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression with the DRX-9000 is an excellent treatment option for herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, nerve root compression, spinal stenosis, facet syndrome, degenerative arthritis and many other forms of chronic lower back pain.

### How does it help?

Non-surgical spinal decompression utilizes state of the art technology that stretches a specified segment of your spine. This gentle stretch is done in such a way as to not create what is known as muscle guarding or spasm. By keeping the muscles that surround your spine relaxed the stretch is able to decompress the specified spinal disc and vertebral area and create a negative pressure in the disc. When disc herniations are present, this decompressive force draws the bulging material back to the center of the disc where it should be, thus alleviating the pressure on the nerve and/or spinal cord structures. Once this pressure is removed, pain is eliminated and your spine can begin to heal and be properly rehabilitated.

### Is it painful?

When a patient is in a significant amount of pain they may not get any appreciable relief at first. But, usually by the third visit, pain levels begin to significantly decrease. The treatment itself is not painful and in fact it feels good. Many of our patients fall asleep while on the table because they are finally getting some relief of their pain.

### Is it covered by insurance?

Non-surgical spinal decompression is not a covered service under health insurance plans. Some clinics may lead patients to believe this to be a covered service, but they are either billing for other services rendered on the same visit or they are using questionable billing practices. Our service is a cash based procedure. Once it has been determined whether or not you are a candidate a complete care plan with pricing will be reviewed with you with payment options.

### Can it help me?

We have been helping people with non-surgical spinal decompression using the DRX-9000 since 2004. We have helped thousands of people get out of pain and get their lives back. They have been able to get off of powerful prescription drugs and avoid surgery. We take great care in determining whether or not a patient qualifies for care. By taking these measures we are able to give our patients the best chance possible of getting well. Obviously we can't help every single person that comes in, but when we review a case that is beyond our abilities we will make sure to refer you our to a specialist who can offer you some viable options.

### How many sessions will I need?

The average treatment plan is 20 visits over a 6 week period. Some cases are different and may require more or sometimes less treatment.

### What does a typical treatment plan look like?

A typical treatment plan consists of 5 visits per week for the first 2 weeks, 3 times per week for the next two weeks and finally two visits per week for the final two weeks.

### Is it expensive?

We have care plans ranging from $2500 to $6000 depending on one's needs.

Once we have all of the results of your tests, we will provide you with a 90 day plan of specific diet and nutritional protocols to follow. After the 90 days re-testing will be performed to monitor your progress.

### What type of results can I expect?

By bringing the body into a state of optimal physiological health your body has all of the materials it needs to heal and maintain a state of health.

We usually place patients on 90 protocols and re-test to determine future needs. Keep in mind that some cases are unique and we may take a different approach in needed.

### Do I have to keep doing it?

The beauty of using laboratory testing to determine a person's nutritional needs is that you only end up taking the nutritional supplements that your body truly needs. It takes the guess work out of nutrition.

### Will I be placed on a specific diet?

They can continue to use our facility or once they have learned how to perform each exercise properly and have a complete understanding of what to do and how to do it, they can choose to exercise on their own.

### How many sessions is it?

We offer a variety of packages based on the findings of the evaluation and the needs of the client. Programs are generally written with a 4 to 6 week period. After the initial period a re-evaluation is performed to determine any changes to the exercise program that may be necessary.
