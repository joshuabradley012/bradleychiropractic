It is important to have an understanding of basic anatomy when learning how to perform abdominal exercises properly. There are four different muscles that make up the abdominal wall. They are the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external obliques and the internal obliques.

The muscles that we will be focusing on today are the lower fibers of the rectus abdominis and the transverse abdominis (TVA).

All muscles have points on the body that they connect to. These points are called origins and insertions. When a muscle contracts it creates tension on these connection points.

They either shorten (concentric contraction), lengthen (eccentric contraction), or stabilize by contracting without shortening or lengthening (static contraction). The origin is the part of that remains stable as the insertion point moves either toward or away from it during a contraction.

The rectus abdominis can switch its origin and insertion depending how the exercise is performed. In a traditional crunch or sit-up exercise the sternum and ribcage (insertion) are moving towards the pelvis (origin) during a concentric contraction. But, if you were to keep your sternum and ribcage still and move your pelvis into flexion you would now be moving your pubic bone (front of your pelvis) towards the ribs and sternum. In doing so you have switched the origin and insertion points by performing the movement in a different manner.

For the first exercise we will be discussing the deepest muscle of the abdominal wall (and often the most neglected), the transverse abdominis. This muscle is known as your internal weight belt because when it contracts properly it stabilizes and decompresses your low back when a heavy load is applied.

The origin of this muscle is the cartilage of the lower ribs 6-12, the thoracolumbar fascia, anterior two-thirds of the iliac crest and the lateral half of the inguinal ligament. The insertion points are the xyphoid process of the sternum, the linea alba and the symphysis pubis. When this muscle contracts it draws the belly button in towards the spine causing an increase in intra-abdominal pressure and thereby creating tensile forces via the connections to the thoracolumbar fascia.

This force causes a decompression of the lumbar spine and aids in stabilizing it, thus preventing injury to the low back while lifting heavy loads. Because of the action on the linea alba this muscle is able to draw the belly button inward.

Many people don’t know how to contract this muscle and therefore have weakness or faulty recruitment of it. In fact, when a person has a weak transverse abdominis they often push their abdomen out instead of in when performing a heavy lift, which makes them prone to injury of the lower back.

So it’s quite simple, if you have difficulty contracting a muscle that pulls your abdomen in towards your spine you will have a protruding abdomen. If you strengthen this muscle and learn how to contract it properly, not only will you prevent injury to your low back but you will create a flatter abdomen.

The second muscle we will discuss is your rectus abdominis, more specifically the lower fibers of this muscle below the belly button (umbilicus) and the pubic symphysis. For the purposes of this discussion and its application to flatten your abs we will be naming the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle the insertion point and the xyphoid process, cartilage of the ribs 5 through 7 the origin.

It is important to note that while the rectus abdominis is one muscle the innervation (nerve supply) of the muscle is made up of the anterior primary rami or T7 through T12. This allows each segment of the muscle to have the ability to contract on its own. By concentrating on the part of the muscle below the belly button to the pubic bone a person can focus the strength building exercise on the lower segments of the muscle.

If a person has weakness in the lower fibers of this muscle their pelvis will most often be held in an anteriorly tilted position creating an increased lordosis (arching) of the lumbar spine and protruding of the abdomen (See diagram 3). Obviously if you can strengthen the lower fibers of the rectus abdominis you will cause an overall shortening of the muscle fibers thereby creating a more posterior tilt of the pelvis and decreasing the protruding abdomen.

Hopefully you are still with me after that anatomy lesson. Now the question is, “what exercises do we need to do and how do we do them?” Great question and I’m prepared to answer it.

The easiest way to assess whether or not you are able to contract your transverse abdominis properly is by taking in a deep breath while holding one hand over your chest and the other over your abdomen.

Go ahead, try it now. What did you notice?

Did your upper hand move upwards and outward while your lower hand didn’t move at all or moved slightly in? If so you may have an inability to contract and control your Transverse abdominis. If you did breathe this way you are not using your diaphragm muscle properly.

When the diaphragm works properly it draws your lungs down and into your abdominal cavity causing your abdomen to protrude.

So the first exercise is to learn how to breathe properly, what is known as diaphragmatic breathing. Simply place your hands as previously described and learn how to make your lower hand move out with your top hand only lifting at the very end of a deep inspiration. This is how we are supposed to breathe.

To see a good example of this just watch a baby or a dog breathe, they breathe diaphragmatically naturally. Once you have mastered this you are ready for the next exercise, the 4-point TVA activation or Tummy Vacuum exercise.

Simply get on your hands and knees (4-point stance) and be sure to have a natural arch in your lower back. Now, take in a deep breath and let your abdomen expand. As you exhale draw your belly button in towards your spine, making sure to keep the natural arch in your spine. Repeat this for 10 repetitions, doing it slowly and controlled being sure to expand your belly upon deep inspiration and draw your belly button in upon expiration. Repeat for a total of 3 sets or 10 repetitions.

The last exercise is referred to by Paul Chek of the C.H.E.K. Institute as the Lower Abdominal 1 exercise. This exercise is performed while lying on your back on a firm, comfortable surface.

The knees are bent to approximately 90 degrees. Draw your TVA inward and simultaneously tilt your pelvis into a posterior position. This was to determine if you are moving your pelvis in the right direction is by paying attention to your lower spine and its position relative to the floor.

If you increase the space between your spine and the floor you have moved in the incorrect position of an anterior pelvic tilt. When done correctly your spine will decrease its arch and move against the floor to the correct position of a posterior pelvic tilt.

You should feel a contraction in the lower fibers of your rectus abdominis. Pay close attention to any contraction of the upper abdominal fibers. You will know they are contracting if your shoulders lift off the ground. If you find yourself doing this it is because you are much stronger in the upper fibers than the lower.

This is quite common because most people who do abdominal exercises always seem to overdo the traditional crunch exercise. By keeping your upper body relaxed and focusing your contraction between the belly button and pelvis you will be able to perform the exercise with proper form. Do this exercise for 3 sets of 10 repetitions.

Both of these exercises are beginning abdominal or core exercises. By performing them correctly you will improve any weaknesses or postural imbalances you may have that are creating a protrusion of the lower abdominal area. You will notice a firmer and flatter abdomen as these imbalances and weaknesses diminish.

Once you have mastered them you will be able to move on to more advanced core training exercises. As with any exercise for abdominal muscles you should not perform these every day. They should be performed approximately 3 times per week with a day or more in between depending on your level of soreness.

If you are experiencing any pain or dysfunction within your lower back or if you need to be evaluated for postural imbalances please contact me or any qualified chiropractor or C.H.E.K practitioner so that you can have a complete evaluation and examination to determine a specified course of care.

Bradley Chiropractic Nutrition Center offers corrective exercise where the patient will be assessed and taught these exercises in person.
