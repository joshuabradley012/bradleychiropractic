When picking out exercises and designing and workout routine it is crucial that you consider what I call your profile of needs. This way your training can have a direct carryover into your real world activities and goals. You will also have an understanding of how your physical abilities work together to produce results.

Movement can be broken down into 8 primary abilities. Any movement is a combination of:

1. Strength
2. Power
3. Speed
4. Agility
5. Endurance
6. Balance
7. Coordination
8. Flexibility

All of these abilities are co-dependent and are all always being used (except when exercising on a machine!). However, for every sport, activity, career, or personal goal, there is a set of biomotor abilities that will be primarily used.

Consider the sprinter compared to the marathon runner.  A sprinter would primarily need speed and power, to move explosively and quickly for a short amount of time. The marathon runner on the other hand primarily needs endurance.

Both are runners, but the approach you would use to train these athletes is very different, as is generally understood. Making a sprinter train by running long distance and doing slow, heavy lifts to build maximal strength would be counter productive. Similarly, training a marathon runner by making them sprint to develop intensive anaerobic endurance would make them unable to run for hours on end.

All this to make the point that we must train appropriately for our primary needs.

Now, one of the best ways to do this is simply to practice your sport or activity! This develops the exact skills you need precisely because you are doing them. I feel that all too often this is a point that is missed by people.

However, there certainly can be an advantage doing specific training outside of your activity as well. Especially if one is lacking in a certain area, or has a dysfunctional movement pattern that needs to be addressed and retrained. As long as one is aware of what their profile of needs is, and has a good set of effective exercises to draw from, that they know how to execute with proper form, training in the gym will make them a better on the field.

It is also especially effective for those such as firemen, where it is hazardous to practice in the field and difficult to simulate working conditions. For those who are not training for a particular activity and are more worried about overall health, this is also a great way to get in exercise in a way that ensures they have a balanced exercise routine.

However, before you begin doing intense exercise, it is important to have direction and to know if you are healthy enough to be working out. If you haven’t determined what your fitness goals are then you need to start with that. Here is my post about Determining Your Goals. After that, check my guide on knowing if you are Healthy Enough to Exercise.

Once you’ve determined your goals and know that you are healthy enough to exercise, it is time to figure out exactly what abilities you should focus on in the gym.

## How to Create A Profile of Needs

Luckily, this step is pretty easy, all that is needed is some thought.

Ask yourself, “What is my main activity/goal, and what do I primarily need to be my best in that activity/goal?” in reference to my list of your eight abilities above. Often this is self-explanatory.

If you are having trouble deciding what ability you specifically need, then consult the following in-depth explanations of the 8 primary biomotor abilities to see what those needs are. There can also be multiple primary abilities needed for specific activities, such as how a soccer player needs speed, endurance, agility, and coordination. But still try to order them from most important to least.

It is also important to consider which abilities you are particularly lacking in. Even if this isn’t your activities primary need, the lack of that ability means you should put more focus into it until it is at the level you need it at. Often this shows up as difficulty executing a specific movement in your sport. Such as having an inconsistent golf swing, or being unable to maintain your balance through a corner on a motocross bike. Flexibility tends to be an especially important ability that many people ignore.

Also, if you are someone who is more interested in personal health goals such as looking or feeling a certain way, it can be difficult to decide which of these abilities you need. There is always the choice of trying to be as balanced in all of these abilities as possible, to be well adjusted to all movements but specified in none.

However, I believe that often you will find that even though your goal is simply to be fit, there is a type of fitness that you idealize. Such as if you want to be heavily muscled, strength training would be for you. Or if you want to have quick reflexes and move effortlessly, agility and coordination would be for you.

Also there can be certain activities that you do, which though you have no desire to pursue these seriously, you could benefit from developing skills in. Such as how a casual runner or hiker could use more endurance, or if you enjoy occasional yoga classes you could benefit from flexibility.

Once you have put together what you believe the primary abilities you need, I talk more later about specific ways to train each of those abilities. But first here is an in-depth explanation of what the eight primary abilities do for you.

### Strength

In general terms, strength is the ability to move as much weight as possible irrespective of the time it takes. Think strongman competitions. Within strength there is also the distinction between absolute and relative strength. Absolute strength is being able to produce as much force as possible without relation to body weight. This type of strength is important in sports such as football where extra body weight is a benefit, and max strength is very important. Then there is relative strength, which is the amount of force you can produce in relation to your body weight, which is important in sports divided by weight class.

### Power

Power is the ability to move explosively, it is how much force you can transfer onto an object in a short amount of time. It is distinct from strength because it is not only about the total load moved, but also the time it took to move it. Power has more to do with intra-muscular coordination than total muscle mass, meaning that you can train someone to be powerful without adding to their weight. This is particularly important in sports where maintaining weight matters, such as in boxing, martial arts, or figure skating.

### Speed

Speed is, as it sounds, purely the ability to move as quickly as possible. It can be the speed of a punch from a single arm, or the speed of your entire body as you move forward. Speed is particularly important in a sport like table tennis, boxing, fencing, or badminton where you must move quickly to strike an object. But speed is also important for sports where the total body is moving as quickly as possible, such as sprinting, speed skating, and basketball.

### Agility

Agility refers to the ability to change the position of the body quickly, often in response to a stimulus. The key here is a change in direction of the body, indicating that something is being avoided or the playing field is unpredictable. Reaction time is also an important factor of agility. Contact sports require a high level of agility, particularly when another player has to be avoided, such as soccer, football, and martial arts.

### Endurance

Endurance is the ability to produce muscular contractions over an extended period of time. This applies to both extreme long distance activities, and activities that require a high output of movement in a short period of time. These can be separated into intensive and extensive endurance. Intensive endurance is when multiple muscular contractions must be made at greater than 50% intensity, such as in wrestling or in an MMA match. Extensive endurance is when one must move at less than 50% intensity for an extended period of time, such as a long distance rower, or even a park ranger. Both require a different training approach.

### Balance

The ability to stay upright and maintain equilibrium is balance. Balance is the result of a complex network of reflexes designed to keep you off the floor, but it can be broken down into two main categories. Righting reflexes work on stable, unmoving surfaces, such as when walking down the sidewalk, or balancing on a balance beam. Tilting reflexes are activated when the surface you stand on is not stable, such as when surfing. Usually both reflex profiles are in use, but there is normally one that is being used predominately. It is important to consider which type of balance is mostly being used in your sport or activity and adjusting your training to it.

### Coordination

Coordination is the ability to use multiple body parts together to result in the intended action. It is used activities that require complex, integrated movements, or very accurate placement of body parts in specific movements. Dancing is a good example of a sport that requires high levels of coordination.

### Flexibility

Finally, and as I’m sure most people know, flexibility is the range of motion that one can move their joints through, stretching the soft tissue around them. Having normal ranges of flexibility is very important for ever sport I can think of in order to move functionally and avoid injury from faulty movement patterns. However, there are some sports and activities where an even greater degree of flexibility is necessary, such as in yoga, gymnastics, and dance.

## How to Target Your Abilities

Now that you’ve determined which of these abilities are the the most important for your sport or activity, it is time to start training them. Below are good, general methods to train each specific ability.

Again, keep in mind which abilities are important for you to have the most of.  Or where you are lacking in a specific ability that though you may not need a lot of, without it you are being held back. So you need to train it to be at the necessary, optimal level.

Also remember that any movement uses and develops all of these abilities at once. So by not focusing on a certain ability, say agility, does not mean that you lose that ability. Which is good because to an extent you need agility in any movement. But you do not have to focus on it specifically because it gets developed through regular training of other areas. However, there is an exception to this.

Using machines to train does not use and develop all of your abilities. Machines stabilize your body for you, which means that the movement patterns that you learn on them have little to no real world application. It allows you to be hyper-specific about the muscle you exercise, but your muscles almost never work in isolation. When, in any activity, do you have a supportive machine stabilizing you ensuring you don’t need to balance or protect your joints? The body is designed to stabilize, balance, and integratively produce power in movements. Training the machines does not make the body do this, and overusing machines can lead to the body forgetting how to integrate. Because of this, machine training should be very limited and specific, if used at all.

Your exercise choices should always be functional movement patterns that have a high carryover into the field or a specific purpose to your goals. For high level athletes, you can often choose very complex exercises that have high carryover into your sport while also developing multiple abilities at once. Such as how an explosive overhead press while kneeling on a swiss ball would develop balance and power, perfect for a figure skater (do not try that one at home).

Form is very important as well, because without good form your body uses substitute movement patterns to complete the exercise. This is less efficient and dangerous, especially considering that people often have bad form because they are trying to do a more complex or heavier lift that they are not prepared for. Unfortunately, continuous improper form also leads to engrained dysfunctions that appear in the field and in every day life. Needless to say, this should be avoided.

For many of the general exercise methods I describe below a very important factor is the rep and set range. I will give some general guidelines of what ranges these should be in for a desired ability. But there is a whole science behind reps, sets, rest and periodization that would be too much to include in this post. So keep an eye out for a post that goes more into detail about that later. For now, hopefully this gives you a good place to begin.

### Strength

Training strength is most often done through weight training. For absolute strength one should be focused on building mass as well as improving their maximal strength. For relative strength only maximum strength should be the focus, which again is intra-muscular coordination doing the work, not extra mass. Rep ranges of 8-12 are best for hypertrophying muscles and building mass, ranges of less than 8 build maximum strength. Either way, when building strength, it is especially important you give your muscles time to rest and regenerate, both in between sets and after a hard day of exercise. Without rest you risk overtraining and losing strength.

### Power

Training power is best done through explosive exercises. Explosive exercises can be modified from other exercises by doing the exercise as fast as possible (if it is safe to do!) and only doing it for as long as that top speed pace can be maintained. A good example is this alternative to the tornado ball exercise. Explosive exercises can be done with weights or body weight, but it is important one is properly fit before attempting to develop power. To not be prepared puts one at risk of injury. So before developing power one must first develop flexibility, then stability, then strength, and finally power. I will write more on this in a later blog post.

### Speed

Training speed is similar to training power, but without any weights at all. Using weights will train your body to be slower than its potential. By using no weights (or only the equipment you use for your sport, such as a tennis racket) you allow your body to accelerate as fast as possible and learn to always move that quickly. Exercises that target certain muscle groups, such as this exercise for your butt, are good if they carry over into your sport. But also practicing a specific movement, or movement that imitates what you do in your activity, is all you need to do, as long as you focus on speed. For example, a MMA fighter could practice kicking and punching quickly on a bag. Do the movement repetitively as fast as you can for as long as you can maintain that top speed.

If you need full body speed, the same principles apply. Practice explosive exercises with no weight for specific muscle groups that will carry over into your activity. Or train moving your entire body as quickly as possible as needed for your activity, whether it is sprinting, speed skating, and so on.

### Agility

Agility is dependent on being able change direction quickly. A great way to train your body to quickly decelerate limbs is by doing eccentric contractions. However, when doing eccentric contractions it is imperative that one has trained for a long time to avoid injury, and care has to be taken to avoid adding muscle mass if that is a concern. Eccentric lifts cause a lot of hypertrophy which facilitates muscle growth. Aside from eccentric lifts, practicing quick retractions of limbs or quickly changing direction when running, sparring, dancing, and so on also develops agility.

Reaction time can also be practiced. Learn to react quickly and appropriately to different stimuli that are present in your sport. Such as the footwork needed to juke a tackle, or the quick ducking needed to dodge a punch.These are best done through direct practice on the field, but can also be done with a good trainer in the gym.

### Endurance

Training endurance has been grossly overused by athletes. So, before doing endurance training, determine that you actually need it for your sport and you’re not doing it because you think it will make you fitter. Also consider whether you need intensive (>50% effort repeatedly) or extensive (<50% effort repeatedly) endurance.

Intensive endurance is trained by working between 40-75% intensity for between 30-120 seconds total time under load. All of which is a fancy way to say you should do 12-20 reps at a tempo that keeps you within 30-120 seconds total time under load. It can be any exercise that trains a movement or muscle group useful to your sport.

Extensive endurance can be trained by keeping the intensity below 40% and having the total time under load at 3-5 minutes. Unfortunately this makes for “boring” exercise that is either slow or repetitive. But, usually the nature of such sports means that you can train this sort of endurance by doing the movement of your activity. Long distance running, long distance rowing, and cross-country skiing are good examples where some of the best endurance training comes from just doing your sport. However, if one still wants to develop endurance in the gym they can do high volume, low intensity lifting for specific muscle groups or movement patterns. They should be below 40% max lift, and be done at least 16-20 reps, though at this intensity often the rep range can be even higher.

### Balance

Balance is extremely important and in my opinion fun to train. Once you have determined if you need more righting (solid surface) or tilting (unstable surface) reflexes, there are many exciting exercises you can choose from. It is best to train the areas of balance where you have the most trouble, such as is it over straight jumps on a motorcycle that you have trouble, or when you are turning and throwing your weight around? However, these exercises are very neurologically demanding, so it is important they are put at the beginning of your training session when you have the necessary energy. Also give yourself a proper rest period, and stop once you can no longer do the exercise effectively.

Training righting reflexes can be done by reducing your base of support in exercises. For example, standing on one leg while doing a cable pull. Or even using a swiss ball (which is normally very unstable) but putting a thick mat under it to reduce movement, and sticking to exercises that keep your weight centered over the ball. Such a swiss ball modification could be used for many exercises, such as crunches, or kneeling on it and doing bent over rows. If this level of training is difficult, simply learning to be balanced on a one foot, or on a stabilized swiss ball, or while using a bodyblade is beneficial.

To train tilting reflexes, the swiss ball, bosu ball, or fitter board becomes an essential tool. Many exercises can then be modified to be done over an unstable surface. This level of balance requires an advanced athlete, so be sure to build up to this level before trying something dangerous. Start with what is challenging to you, but not dangerously difficult, and build from there. But, if you have the ability, do the exercises that challenge you where you are the weakest, such as kneeling on a swiss ball and tossing a medicine ball, or doing a squat on a swiss ball. Again, pick a movement that mimics the area of balance that you struggle the most with.

### Coordination

Training coordination can be done by developing the body’s ability to perform complex movement patterns and reinforcing correct, fundamental patterns that the body can draw from. Having an optimal range of motion of joints is especially important for coordination, because without this the body will compensate to complete movements, resulting in sloppy, unreliable form. To reinforce fundamental movement patterns, be sure to train with proper form in bending, squatting, twisting, lunging, pushing, and pulling exercises. For activities that require coordination, a combination of these movements is used. So if you practice these fundamental movements with perfect form in the gym, you develop a strong foundation for these movements that your brain will refer to when performing a more complex movement.

Coordination can also be developed by training the bodies ability to adapt to new and complex movements. Rather than sticking with the same general exercises for months, experiment and find new, complex exercises that require full body integration, such as the supine lateral ball roll. Your exercise choices should be varied and changed at regular periods.

### Flexibility

Flexibility is developed by stretching. Again, most sports only need normal ranges of flexibility, meaning you should only stretch the areas that are problematic. Being overly flexible in high intensity sports can cause joint instability and should be avoided. However, there are activities that require higher levels of flexibility, in these cases I would caution you to ensure that you continue to main a proper level of stability and strength in your joints or you risk injury.

Static stretching is best done at night so your body can remember the new length of the muscles as you sleep. If you stretch before exercising, you should do it using dynamic stretching to avoid confusing your muscles. Dynamic stretching is done by reaching end ranges of motion and feeling a stretch, but never stopping to hold a stretch. Instead you bounce back and forth between feeling no stretch and feeling the stretch. In constant movement your body responds differently, producing results that are optimal for exercise. Another option to stretching is doing mobility exercises, such as the Feldenkrais shoulder spine integrator. These too can be done before exercise, or they can also be combined in stretching.

## Conclusion

Now you are ready to begin working out exactly as you need to get the most benefits out of the gym! It is very important with any exercise routine you give yourself the rest you need both during the workout to let your nervous and muscular system recharge, and post-workout to allow your body to fully repair and manage the extra stress exercise presents.

Until net time, continue improving your weaknesses, and keep an eye out for my next post that will go into the process of building power in areas of your body that are completely dysfunctional.

I hope with this information you can begin to develop your abilities and be your best self.
