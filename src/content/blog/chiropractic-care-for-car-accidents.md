Chiropractic care is an excellent treatment for car accidents. Because often, car accidents don’t cause severe enough of an injury for hospitals to do anything about, other than prescribe pain medications. But that doesn’t treat the root of the pain, it only covers it up.

In Bakersfield, California Dr. Bradley has the most experience with treating car accident patients. He, and other chiropractors, specialize in the structure of the human body and use adjustments to realign areas that were causing pain or dysfunction. If you’ve been in a car accident and are within driving distance of Bakersfield, consider coming to our chiropractic office.

If not in the area, Google and Yelp are handy to find anything.

## How Chiropractic Helps After a Car Accident

Many times paramedics will respond to a car accident and determine there aren’t any injuries severe enough to be treated in a hospital. However, these injuries can still cause people pain. That is the perfect time to visit me or another chiropractor. Chiropractors specialize in the care of bones, muscles, nerves and connective tissue making us excellent for treatment after a car accident.

One of the most common injuries that occurs in car accidents is whiplash. When your car gets hit and moves around violently, your body is held in place to avoid serious injury. Unfortunately with your body held in place, your head “whips” through an excessive range of motion, contributing to hyperflexion-hyperextension injuries that can affect soft tissues in the neck, as well as joint capsules and interverte­bral discs.

Whiplash can lead to these symptoms:

- Blurred vision
- Neck pain
- Headaches
- Dizziness
- Shoulder pain
- Reduced range of motion in the neck
- Arm pain
- Neck stiffness
- Low back pain

Other injuries can also occur in car accidents, many of which I may be able to help. The jarring of a car accident can displace any joint in the body or cause spasms in muscles. I specialize in realigning joints and have many techniques to help muscles relax. Also, in my office I also have a massage therapist and a corrective exercise coach, both of whom can help ease and correct your injuries.

## Seek Chiropractic Treatment Soon

No matter the injury, it is crucial that if you suffer from a car accident that you seek care as quickly as possible. The longer the injuries go untreated, the harder they become to treat and the more possible it is that long term pain will be induced. Especially with whiplash. If you come in soon after your accident, it is likely that we will be able to help you recover quickly.

Long term pain happens when your body begins to adapt to the new position it is the best it can to continue functioning, but this unfortunately means that any misalignments and imbalances become deeply engrained in your body. The more deeply ingrained they become, the more difficult they are to reverse to get out of pain and back to health.

If you can receive care before this happens, it is always optimal. However, if you are reading this suffering pain from a long past accident, there is still something you can do. It will take more work, but with a combination of techniques including chiropractic, exercise, massage, and even nutrition, you can manage your pain.

With these techniques you can begin to retrain the muscles that are prolonging your imbalance and realign your joints in a way that will provide lasting relief. For deep imbalances, an adjustment alone may provide temporary relief, but usually to have lasting relief a combination of techniques is necessary. It’s possible, with time and devotion, that any pain you may be suffering can be overcome.
