Recently I noticed myself slipping from doing what is most important.

The dangerous part is that I wasn’t doing anything particularly “bad” only distractions were consuming my time, like obsessively checking my inbox and checking website metrics (without good reason), doing housecleaning type work, surfing the web, watching Youtube, reading blogs, looking at social media, and so on. I still was doing my work, still feeling okay about my day, but I wasn’t growing. I was stagnant.

This came after a spell of productivity so great that I felt I was on the brink of finally crossing over to a place where distraction could no longer bother me. I was making the most of every moment, absolutely aware of what was most important to me and how I could achieve it. Distractions felt distant. Real work of writing, promoting, creating, educating, learning, and growing was what consumed my day and I loved it.

As with every time I was in that place though, it was transitory. Within a weeks I could feel the shift beginning, the banal becoming more appealing than the sublime. I knew I would be stuck there for weeks, maybe months, until inspiration struck once again. And so it goes.

These cycles of going from extreme productivity to relapsing into a time of distraction is something I’ve been acutely aware of for some time. Mostly because I am always watching myself, and partly because I always wonder why I can’t stay in these states of intense focus. I sort of assumed there is just a natural ebb and flow, and as long as I caught it and snapped myself out of it before it went to far, I’d be okay.

I’ve also noticed that my mood tracked with these cycles, and I’d thought that maybe they were the source of my behavior.

While in a state of producing a lot, writing, exercising, closely watching what I eat, meditating, I feel awake, alive to all of the sensations of the world and tuned in to my emotions and those around me. In short, I feel impervious.

When I let myself fall to the mundane, everything feels dull. Sure, I still smile, I still laugh, I still live, but I don’t have that awareness that keeps me gripping to the edge of my seat in awe of the universe. I feel more irritable, more judgmental, more self-sabotaging, and less able to respond efficiently and effectively to whatever life throws at me. Then those distractions sound oh so much better, because they’re simple and comforting.

As Nietzsche says, they’re “wretched contentment.”

However, I’m starting to consider that my mood isn’t the cause but the result of something greater, that encompasses my being distracted as well. The shift in my thinking came from the book I am reading “The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield. His incredible, inspirational book is all about identifying, combating, and flourishing in the face of what he labels as “Resistance.”

## The Resistance Against Goals

Because I can’t put it better myself, in Steven Pressfield's own words, this is Resistance:

> Have you ever brought home a treadmill and let it gather dust in the attic? Ever resolved on a diet, a course of yoga, a meditation practice? Have you ever felt a call to embark upon a spiritual practice, dedicate yourself to a humanitarian calling, commit your life to the service of others? Have you ever wanted to be a mother, a doctor, an advocate for the weak and helpless; to run for office, crusade for the planet, campaign for world peace or to preserve the environment? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.
>
> Every sun casts a shadow, and genius’ shadow is Resistance. As powerful as is our soul’s call to realization, so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it. Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine. We’re not alone if we’ve been mown down by Resistance; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us. And here’s the biggest bitch: we don’t even know what hit us. I never did. From age twenty-four to thirty-two, Resistance kicked my ass from East Coast to West and back again thirteen times and I never even knew it existed. I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.
>
> Look in your own heart. Unless I’m crazy, right now a still small voice is piping up, telling you as it has ten thousand times, the calling that is yours and yours alone. You know it. No one has to tell you. And unless I’m crazy, you’re no closer to taking action on it than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow. You think Resistance isn’t real? Resistance will bury you.

Resistance is invisible, internal, insidious, implacable, and universally effects humanity. It is the self-sabotaging fear that strikes when we reject “immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, integrity.” It is fueled by fear and hits us the hardest when we are the closest to defeating it and accomplishing something meaningful to ourself.

To fit this idea better into my belief system I see this as a part of the ego. What the ego wants most is to be fed the same self-affirming truths that it is who you are, that there is no separation of self, that your past absolutely defines your being. Change threatens this entire structure, so the ego creates Resistance anywhere, any way it can.

For me resistance shows up in my life the most as procrastination. I go through my days entertaining the notion that once I’m done, I’ll get to it. Once I’m done with my busy work, done checking my emails, done studying, done with this one last video, done with this book, done healing to perfection, done with everything but the thing I need to do the most, I’ll get to it. But that day never comes.

Or, even worse I rationalize why I must or should do these other things first, often with good reason. But I trade doing what is urgent for what is important and let resistance win. Someone truly with the upper-hand against resistance would push through any rationalized procrastination and get their work done. Pressfield reminds us that Tolstoy wrote “War and Peace” despite having thirteen children.

Though I only mentioned two personal examples, make no mistake, Resistance comes in many forms.

Pressfield asserts that Resistance is the root of all unhappiness, and I’m inclined to agree. It is the part of our ego that feeds on insecure identity, restlessness, indecision, instant gratification, unfulfilling materialism, identifying with “truth,” and through fear ensures that we do nothing to escape this sentencing. It powerfully drives us away from our calling because that is what threatens Resistance the most. And from this Resistance stems many, if not all, of the problems in our personal lives, communities, and the world.

Perhaps this is why we at times long for the clarity of disaster. Some secret part of us craves for calamity to strike and wipe away all of our limitations. A fresh start without the expectations of our old life. An opportunity to chase that inner calling with unbounded freedom.

I’ve already had “disaster” moments, and though much good came from them, they weren’t extreme enough to finalize the transformation. The truth is that no escape can separate me from my past nor can they drive away Resistance fully. And disaster isn’t necessary to change my life, change can happen right now.

Action is all that is needed.

## The Plan

First of all, I will finish “The War of Art.” The book is only about 200 pages and separated into three movements, but I am hanging on to each passage and rereading them until they stick to my mind. I’ve read through “Resistance” and “Combating Resistance,” and will finish with “Beyond Resistance.”

But relying on finishing the book is a form of Resistance itself. I already know deep in my soul what I need to do the most because it is what I resist and fear doing the most.

Meditation, exercise, eating well, journaling, writing, playing music, and strong, challenging relationships are the nourishment my soul needs to stay strong and lead me directly to my dream. That is to be whole, awake, aware, connected, contribute meaningful and beautiful works to humanity, and inspire others to teach themselves to be whole as well. But that is easier said than done.

The real struggle is waking up every day prepared ready to fend off resistance, because it never goes away. And the stronger I get, the more I break into that zone of productivity, so to Resistance grows. It looks for every opportunity to tempt and distract you, pulling you in with a single action in the wrong.

Defeating Resistance begins by doing what is important first, and continues by remembering to always do what is important first. To foster that awareness and habit is what it takes. In Pressfield’s words, you have to “turn pro.”

I have to start by incorporating these practices into my life at a pace that keeps me from burning out. To be aware of my energy levels and my willpower and to do what is necessary to keep those up. To streamline my routine. To act in the face of fear. To focus my attention on my labors and not their fruits. To remain unattached to my successes or identity. To not take failure personally. To recognize my limitations. To master my arts.  And most importantly to show up every day to do the work no matter the playing field, no matter the excuse, no matter how long it takes.

The power to change our life is always in our grasp.

Of course, everyone’s calling is different and I believe that as one evolves so can their calling. But the principles remain the same.

This post was the first step for me. I will have ups and downs, this will not be a straightforward process and I will likely fall hard several more times. However, now I have this knowledge. I am more aware of Resistance as it is and how it operates. I am more ready than ever to continue fighting now that I have identified the enemy.

I am devoted to stay on top of this, and hopefully all of you will be able to track the change. Or, better yet, decide to make the change yourself.
