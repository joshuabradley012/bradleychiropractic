To be powerful you need to be stable. I know this isn’t what you wanted to hear because you were looking for some quick and easy tip to give you a 100% boost, but before you leave hear me out. This method takes time and effort, but it is extremely effective and is well worth your time to at least be exposed to.

My logic is simple, you need a strong base of support if you are going to have any hope of effectively using your power. A nice analogy, that I have seen Paul Chek use many times, is imagine shooting a cannon from a canoe. It would be inaccurate, you have to limit the size of the cannon, and even then it would be very dangerous.

Trying to be powerful without first laying the foundations would be like shooting that cannon off of a canoe, your movement would be inconsistent, you would limit your power output, and you would be a walking injury waiting to happen. Alternately, if you lay a solid physical foundation, you would be powerful, accurate, and stable enough in all situations to avoid many injuries (unfortunately proper exercise does not make you bulletproof so I can’t guarantee you won’t get hurt).

Laying the foundation for power requires flexibility, stability, then strength, in that order, before you should even be concerned with being powerful. In this guide I will go through the steps you need to develop power on your own, and hopefully if you apply this in your own practice you’ll be replacing that canoe with a warship in no time.

## Flexibility

Flexibility is first because it is the most important. In this context I don’t mean flexibility as in being able to do full side splits splits and twist yourself into a pretzel, but as in having enough flexibility to move through normal ranges of motion, or whatever range of motion your sport requires. Why flexibility is most important is easy to understand, you can’t be stable if you can’t even get your body to where it needs to be to complete the movement. Or you can’t be properly stable if you are compensating elsewhere to complete a movement.

This is often one of the most overlooked areas of fitness, even by professional athletes, so don’t skip it! Also, watch that you don’t only stretch the areas that are already flexible and are easy/fun to stretch. Though it can feel good to do this, it really is your tightest, most painful areas that need to be stretched the most.

I recommend developing your stretching routine by exploring your body and finding your tightest areas to focus on stretching them. Go through stretches that stretch muscles from head to toe paying attention to tight areas, and paying particular attention to areas that are significantly tighter on one side than the other. Here is a good guide to a full body stretch routine that you can use to find your tight areas.

Once you’ve identified your tight areas either commit them to memory, or write them down because we’re going to use them later. Also just because you know where you are stiff now, don’t forget to occasionally explore. It is possible to become stiff in areas that previously weren’t tight, or new areas will reveal themselves as comparatively tight as you begin to loosen up.

Now before you go stretching gung-ho, lets talk about different styles of stretching, and when to do it. This may seem pedantic, but trust me that it is important.

### Stretching Techniques

When it comes to stretching there are three broad categories of stretching. There is dynamic stretching, static stretching, and the contract release technique. After introducing these methods, I’ll talk about applying them to your stretching routine.

**Dynamic stretching** is done by never stopping to hold a stretch. If you remember doing “around the worlds” and “cotton pickers” on the schoolyard, you get the basic idea. You want to move to the end ranges of a motion where you begin to feel a stretch, but don’t hold it. Instead you move through that area, increasing the stretch and letting off back and forth. Don’t move fast either, but keep a nice, slow tempo to warm up the joints and to keep from confusing the brain into thinking the muscle is longer than it is. This keeps your muscles ready to stabilize while also warming them up and stretching them. Also, remember to breathe, find a nice pace and follow your breath as you move to keep a good tempo.

**Static stretching** is the exact opposite of dynamic stretching. With this type of stretching you hold stretches for extended periods of time to lengthen muscles, ligaments, and tendons. I find it best to hold stretches for a total of at least a minute, which you can break up into 30 second, 15 second, or even 10 second pieces, or do one long stretch (as I prefer). Be careful to avoid over-stretching, especially with this technique. There is a fine balance between stretching deeply, which provides deep relief, and over-stretching, which causes your muscles to react and tighten. Listen to your body to find this balance, pay attention to when you are no longer gaining range of motion for that day, and keep your stretching to within three sets for each muscle.

The **contract release technique** is a variation of static stretching that focuses more on lengthening the muscles than the connective tissue. To do this, you alternate between contracting the muscle you are stretching, then relaxing and immediately stretching more deeply into the muscle, taking advantage of the extra range of motion the contraction created. You contract for 5 seconds while inhaling, then relax for 5 seconds while exhaling, repeating this three to five times on each muscle, or until you can no longer extend your range of motion. The breathing is important, so pay attention to it. Again, avoid over stretching by listening to your body and keeping your stretching within three sets.

### When to Stretch

Remember those tight areas? Good, you’re going to use that list for some of these methods, but not all.

Note that all stretching is best done once the body is warm to the point where you feel you are just about to sweat. Light exercise, warm weather, a warm room, or a warm shower or bath can warm up your body. This is important if you play an outdoor sport in an area where it gets cold.

Developmental stretching is specifically for targeting your tightest areas. This is for those whose lack of flexibility could potentially effect the way they play, such as tight hips restricting a golf swing. You should do this type of stretching either before exercising, or before falling asleep, or both. But never before playing a game or participating in an event. Only stretch your tight areas that you have on your list, avoiding areas that have normal flexibility. Use either static stretching or the contract release technique for this method.

Pre-event stretching is done, as the name suggests, before participating in your sport or activity. Because you are about to use your body in a dynamic way that requires stabilization you want to avoid stretching in a way that changes the way your brain thinks about the length-tension relationships in your muscles. This is a fancy way to say that you should only be doing dynamic stretching. Keep moving, breathe, and warm up your joints. Focus on loosening up problematic areas that you identified and areas that you know you are about to use in your sport, or any areas where you are sore from old injuries or new pains.

Now there is a caveat pre-event stretching, but it requires having some knowledge or doing some homework. I said to only do dynamic stretching, but in fact, if you can identify some of the muscles on your list as tonic muscles, then you can stretch them using static stretching or the contract release technique before playing. You can check whether a muscle is tonic or not by referring to the chart about a third of the way down of this page. However, I added this as an aside because if you do not take the time to identify your problematic muscle as tonic, it is not worth risking stretching in the wrong way before a game. Although, I highly recommend that you do take the time to figure this out because it can be hugely beneficial.

Post-event stretching is done to avoid post game soreness. It isn’t necessary, but it is a good way to stay limber and avoid being overly sore so you can back to training and playing. It should be done on every muscle group that was used intensively during an activity. It can look a lot like your pre-event stretching, except it can use any method of stretching. Dynamic stretching, static stretching, and the contract release technique are all options. However, keep in mind that this is not a replacement for developmental or maintenance stretching. If you are tight or want to avoid being tight, post-event stretching is not enough.

Maintenance stretching is the last type of stretching and it should be done by everyone. Once you have done enough developmental stretching to have adequate flexibility, you can switch over to maintenance stretching. Or if you never had problems and don’t feel tight, it is important to do maintenance stretching so you don’t develop imbalances and tight areas. This stretching uses static stretching and the contract release technique to target the main areas used by your activity. figure out what muscles you use the most and stretch them daily either before exercising, or before falling asleep, or both. This will keep your muscles from tightening after use.

And that’s it! Use these techniques and you’ll see huge improvements in the way you move. You can start stretching right away and do it concurrently along with the rest of the steps to developing power, especially with stability training. However, you should only perform certain high intensity exercises once you have developed the flexibility to avoid injury or poor motor-programming. That is why stretching comes first.

## Stability

Training stability is important for anyone who feels that they lack consistency in their movement, or feels that they aren’t adequately able to deliver power. It is especially important for those who have recently been injured or are in pain, because often those are signs of poor stability, and now the injured area will be problematic and require retraining which starts with stability.

A very important aspect of training stability is learning what perfect posture looks and feels like. Because I’ve already created a post about this, I won’t repeat myself on how to find perfect posture in yourself, so here is my post on finding imbalances and developing perfect posture. The basic idea is that you need to know what perfect posture is to be able to practice it. And you need to practice perfect posture to develop optimal stability and biomechanics.

Why it is so important is because your body gets “programmed” by the movements you do. It learns to fire specific nerve sequences when you want to make a certain movement, and learns the pathway you use the most to be more efficient. But if the pathway you teach your body is a faulty one, then you will always perform faulty movement. But if you learn to practice with perfect posture, then you teach your body proper movement patterns that it will default to when performing an activity.

Perfect posture is also important because it the start and end point of all movement. With proper posture, the body is aligned to perform as it was designed with a good center of gravity and ideal conditions for joint muscle complexes to work in. Both of these factors are obviously (or at least I hope it’s obvious) the basis of good stability.

Practicing perfect posture also requires perfect form. Again, this is good “programming” for the nervous system. Now, I’ll stop boring you about posture and form and get into the three phases of developing stability. Unfortunately I have to admit that the beginning stages of this are very boring while also being very difficult. But if you can get through it, you will have a seriously strong foundation to play off of.

For the best results, perform each phase of stability training for 4-6 weeks before progressing. These exercises can be done while simultaneously developing flexibility, as long as the movement restriction isn’t so severe it keeps you from having proper form. However, for most of these exercises, you can be very restricted and still execute them with proper form so in general you should be okay to go right away.

### Isolation

The first step of developing stability is to ensure that each of the main stabilizer groups are strong on their own. You’ll want to hone in primarily on your back and core as this is where your most important stabilizers are. Exercises such as horse stance, prone cobra, back extensions, reverse hyper extensions, and correct lower abdominal exercises are excellent for this purpose. Each of those links will take you to a video explaining those exercises.

You’ll also want to add in exercises for areas that are used particularly in your sport, or where you know you are weak or have been injured. I find myself doing a lot of hip extensions, lunges, and calf lifts, all slowly, with my clients that come to me with knee pain. The neck and shoulders are also areas of particular concern.

To understand better how to train for stability, you should know that stabilizer muscles don’t fatigue until 3-5 minutes of work. So you have to do exercises that are slow or require long holds to accesses these muscles. You want the “time under tension” to be at least 1 minute and up to 3 minutes. “Time under tension” can be estimated by keeping track of how long one rep takes and adusting the rep range to get the total time under tension to where you need it to be.

For example, lets say you do a slow back extension with a 3 second lift, 3 second hold, and 3 seconds to return to the start. Each rep would take 9 seconds, so you would want to do at least 7 reps and do as many as 20 to work the stabilizer muscles. This way your total time under tension is between 1 and 3 minutes.

Again, with these exercises, put your effort into practicing with perfect form. This is the only way they will truly benefit you.

### Integration

Integration exercises are simply the progression from isolation exercises. You will begin to incorporate more muscle groups into the exercise so they have to coordinate to provide stability. This is a very important step because in most situations the body uses integrated muscle groups to complete a movement pattern, so it is important to begin training the body to be stable in this situation.

Targeting these muscles uses the same methods as described in isolation, with 1-3 minutes of time under tension per set. The exercises need to be more complex, incorporating more complex movement and stability on multiple planes. Exercises such as the forward ball roll, supine hip extensions, one armed bridges with your feet on a swiss ball, and frontal plane leans are all excellent options. Again, there are links to videos for each of those.

To be honest, the distinction between an isolation and integration can seem rather vague. There isn’t always a clear cut line between the two. But you can see the obvious progression to more challenging exercises that require the use of more muscle groups. That is the basic premise, to build from simple to complex exercises that require stability.

### Dynamic Stability

Again moving up the chain of increasing complexity, these exercises are meant to teach the body to be stable in movement. These require a high level of integration on often incorporate multiple planes of stability at once. These will be challenging exercises, and much more fun to do than the previous ones. However, because they are so challenging, take them slow and build your strength, always focusing on form. Once you have mastered these exercises you should see noticeable increases in performance and can safely begin strength and power training.

Some examples of these exercises are the prone jack knife, supine lateral ball roll, russian twist, and prone twister. Once again, links send you to videos explaining how to do the exercises. Especially with these exercises, be sure to do them with perfect form at all times. If you cannot maintain good form, go back to the earlier exercises and do them until you have built the necessary stability.

Another useful set of exercises for this stage are balance training exercises, such as kneeling on a swiss ball, standing on a bosu ball, on a wobble board, or on a pro fitter board. Using these alone and staying on them as long as possible is an excellent dynamic stability work out, only be careful to stop once tired because it will be a tired nervous system which takes time to recover, and falling is not usually a good thing.

## Strength

Strength training is the final before getting to power. Now that you have the ability to stabilize your joints instantaneously in any position and while moving, it’s time to build strength on top of that foundation.  Note that you should only begin strength training once you have gained adequate flexibility, otherwise you will engrain faulty movement patterns and only continue shorten your tight muscles.

A strength training routine is different for each person depending on their needs. Different sports, occupations, and physical builds require focusing on specific areas for that individual. If you don’t have help in picking these exercises, be sure to choose ones that strengthen areas you will use in your sport or activity.

Be sure to choose exercises that require you to strengthen in a way that incorporates stability, which is pretty easy as long as you avoid doing exercises from machine or from full body supports (such as laying on the ground). When there is no need for your body to stabilize because you’re already being supported, your brain doesn’t waste energy sending signals to your stabilizer muscles. However, this also means that you are “programming” your body to not use your stabilizers! This is exactly what I’m trying to teach people to avoid by writing this, and you would be setting yourself up for injury.

Alright, so exercises that require stabilization, such as using unsupported lifts, cable machines, free weights, and swiss balls are all great options. Also you want to perform exercises that continue integrating full body movements. For example, a cable push ties together your legs, abs, and arms if done correctly. Always be looking to learn from for people that explain exercises fully and focus on form, either in person or online, so that you can do exercises in this manner.

I mentioned picking exercises that strengthen areas you will use. An easier way to consider what movements these might be is to consider your “primal movement patterns” as developed by Paul Chek. The archetypes of all movement are the push, pull, bend, squat, twist, and lunge. All other movements are simply variations or combinations of this and can be identified in these. So look at what movements you do the most and determine which movement pattern it best fits in to start training with exercises in that area. Usually, a sport or activity requires multiple movement patterns, but will primarily use a few. Although there are cases where all movement patterns need to be strengthened.

Don’t be afraid to perform super specific exercises either. If it is a certain movement that you struggle in, then modify your exercises to mimic that movement as closely as possible and train with it. It will get rid of your weaknesses quickly. But if you are going for general strength, training with more general variations of archetypal movement patterns gives a good reference for your brain to draw from when in action.

Once you’ve figured out what exercises to do, here are some general rules of thumb on how to train for strength. Perform your exercseis at a moderate tempo usually with a 2 second lift and 2 second return to start, and normally within a 8-12 rep range for 2-4 sets. The set range depends on your level of training and the amount of time you need to spend to see benefits. However, the rep range and tempo are pretty standard. Pick a weight that lets you stay within that rep range. If you can’t do that many you’re going to heavy, and if you can easily do more than that you’re going too light. You want to be pretty fatigued, feeling that you can only do 2-3 more reps when you stop an exercise within that 8-12 rep range. The tempo is also pretty standard as this will build the strength and coordination necessary to do more explosive power training later on.

However, of course these variables are not universal. A good trainer would fine tune these variables depending on the exercise and the clients needs. But if you are exercising on your own this is a good rule of thumb to follow. Do your first set of exercises for 4-6 weeks, then progress to another set of exercises that are a little more challenging for another 4-6 weeks. Then finally you can progress to the final step, developing power!

## Power

Finally, you have built up your body to be able to handle power. Now you have the necessary foundation of range of motion, stability, and strength to deliver consistent, safe, explosive movement. The difference between power and strength, if you didn’t know, is the amount of time it takes to complete the movement. Strength is irrespective of time and you can take as long as you want to lift something. Power is to lift that same weight as quickly as possible.

A good demonstration of the difference would be to have a strong person and a powerful person throw a medicine ball as far as they can. The strong person will probably throw the ball far, but the powerful person will throw it much further because of the force they were able to produce in a short period of time.

When building power, you want to choose very specific exercises that have a high carry-over to your activity. Unlike strength training where you focused on primal movement patterns, for power you want to pick exercises that have a direct carry-over to a movement you use on the field.

Performing power training should be done doing exercises with high speed and intensity. It is very important to warm up before doing a full power set, you can do this by doing a set of your chosen exercises at a moderate pace. It is also very important that when doing these exercises you stop as soon as you fatigue. You are training to be explosive, so training past where you can produce maximum speed is detrimental to your development.

For example, if you are doing an explosive twisting exercise, you warm up, reach your max speed, and only do it for as long as you can maintain that max speed, which is normally only after about 10-15 seconds.

Because of this, you will do your exercises with a fast tempo, of about 1 second lift, 1 second return while learning them, and progress to doing the explosively, or as fast as you can. At this intensity, your rep ranges will normally be within 4-8 reps. Be aware that the less reps you do, the better form and the more experience is required. Do not attempt max lifts if you haven’t been training consistently for years and if you do not have a good spotter!

That being said, keep your movement explosive, stopping once you start slowing down, and doing 2-4 sets of each exercise. You’ll also want to rest for four days in between each unique set of exercises. So, let’s say you have Program A and Program B. You could do Program A on Monday, and Program B on Tuesday, but shouldn’t do Program A again until Friday, nor Program B again until Friday. That’s a little confusing, but just remember four days rest between each unique set of exercises.

Once again, technique is extremely important. Be sure to have perfect form and give yourself time to learn the exercises before attempting to do them explosively. This will keep you safe and let you have good motor programming.

You’ll also train in power for less time than the others, training only 3-4 weeks before changing exercises to more complexity. Then doing those new exercises for 3-4 weeks before being done with power training. At this intensity, you may feel joint soreness or experience losses in stability and strength, this is normal. But because of this, have a tapering off week after each 3-4 week period where you only do half the number of sets for the last week.

And finally you’ve trained for power!

## Wrapping It Up

So that’s it! It’s hard to go into exact detail about strength and power exercises because there aren’t any general exercises that cover it all. But I hope that you learned something and can understand the principles I presented here. When training you want to move correctly so that you can move correctly on the field is, and correct movement is optimal movement. By laying a foundation of flexibility, stability, and strength, you can ensure that you will have a solid foundation to perform your best from.

Just in case you’re not tired of me saying it, I’ll say it again. All of these exercises are useless without perfect form. Be sure to learn the proper way to do the exercise, and then practice until you are doing it exactly like that.

An excellent resource for learning how to do exercises with proper form is any of the CHEK Institute material. Particularly for this post I used The Golf Biomechanics Manual which is ideal for golfers, but it includes material that anyone can learn from.

Here’s my last piece of advice. As I mentioned in the power section, you will begin to loose some stability and strength after training for power intensely. This is normal, but you need to pay attention to it otherwise you risk overtraining or loosing those abilities you worked so hard to develop. What you should do after completing a phase of power training is reassess yourself and see if you need more stability, more strength, or you’re okay on both and still need more power.

If you feel you’ve lost some stability, go back to train that, then go through strength training, and finally return to power training. If you feel that you’ve lost some strength, go back to strength training, then progress to power training. And once you reach power training again, reassess again! It’s a constant cycle of strengthening your weaknesses to be in the best shape you can be.

Luckily, each time you go back to stability or strength training you will be stronger than the last time and will only continue getting stronger. Don’t give up, it’ll will be hugely beneficial for you.

And that’s it, again I hope you learned something, and I hope you’ll implement some of these things into your training routine to be the best you can be.
