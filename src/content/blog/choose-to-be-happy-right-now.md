I was driving in my car feeling bummed, when for some reason my awareness shifted from being an experiencer to being an observer. I could feel the negativity of these thoughts sitting in back of my mind and wondered if instead of holding on to that pain I could choose to be happy instead. Almost in the same moment I was blissful.

As soon as it happened I doubted and rejected the experience. I felt like a cheat and a thief to experience happiness so easily. So often I have told myself that such happiness has to be earned through practice, it isn’t something that one could simply wish upon themselves. Otherwise the happiness is delusional, isn’t it?

But I allowed myself to feel that happiness again, and sure enough it was still there, as deep and vital as any “real” happiness I’d experienced before. I enjoyed it in its fullness for a while before thoughts and the expectedness of routine filled in again, returning me to the unfortunately normal world of living in my head.

I think a large part of that moment was subconsciously letting go of my self-narrative and giving in to the moment, the bliss of non-ego and mindfulness that is talked about in so many different ways. However, it opened up an interesting question for myself. Can happiness really be that easy to obtain? And if so, why don’t we choose happiness?

Personally I have put a lot of work into improving myself, eating right, moving right, thinking right, digging through my pains to find why they are still there and trying to get to their root, and noticing when I begin to fall into habits of distraction so I can stop them as quickly as possible. So part of me wonders if the reason I was able to choose happiness for that moment was precisely because of all that I have done to improve myself, and if it is not something that is attainable for everyone. But I doubt this.

While all the self-work I have done probably helped, joy isn’t nestled in doing things, waiting to spring out once enough boxes have been checked off. Joy is a matter of perception. It is that moment of rapture when colors, lights, and shadows seem to pop and the ears hear with perfect stereo sound.

Often such moments of awe, as Jason Silva talks about beautifully, can be set of by new or overwhelming experiences that force us to heighten our awareness to fully process the unexpected wonder of what is coming in. It can be something like Carl Sagan’s “Pale Blue Dot” that expands our mind and redefines what we think ourselves to be, it can be a serene observation made in meditation, or it can be sharing a perfect moment with a loved one.

But such tools are not necessary.

At the root of all of these moments is that sudden, heightened awareness that places one momentarily in the present. All it takes is dropping that expectation of what is happening and “being what I think other people think I am” to open oneself to the here and now. And that is why I think happiness might truly be a choice.

It is within all of our powers to bring our awareness to the present, as I did in the car. I became aware of my unhappiness, and in that awareness it dissolved, leaving me in the moment with the recognition that of course I could choose to be happy. My reality is what I make of it.

How powerful it is to be able to fold in on oneself, to become aware of your awareness and recognize it is in your control. We can literally choose to make the world our own. Being in the moment, pursuing our calling, living with passion and purpose, being vulnerable and honest are all things that can be done right now. So why don’t we?

Perhaps because we make excuses, fall into habits, are afraid to fail, have other things we are doing that are more important. Because it takes time and energy that we don’t have, we’re comfortable, because most people don’t do that. Because we’re afraid to have a bad life, afraid to go insane, afraid to die. Perhaps.

Or maybe it is as Steven Pressfield says in the most shocking line of his must-read book “The War of Art.”

Because we fear that we will succeed.

Successfully shifting our perception would change everything in our life. Much of the life we have built, from friends, family, hobbies, and profession, is based on the version of ourself that we accept. It envelops our fears, anxieties, unhappinesses, but also holds the comfortable promise of consistency and small but regular rewards. To suddenly choose to live in the moment would strip all of this away.

The idea of being a new person, losing many friends, losing touch with family, changing your career, adopting a new lifestyle, and being deeply, unshakably happy is as terrifying as it is attractive. It is threatening to the ego because it is a transformation, and it is terrifying to us because we might end up alone.

But we wouldn’t be alone. We would be connected to Self, to creativity, to happiness, and would find new, truer friends and lovers who we could connect with on a new level. This is where its attractiveness comes from. We would live the life that we have always secretly known in our heart to be our true self.

It is not a cheat, and it is not false happiness. There aren’t required steps we have to take to choose deep happiness, there is only one. To wake up right now.

I know I’m trying. My personal experience is that while the choice is simple, staying awoken is difficult. There are internal and external forces that we experience every day that want to pull us back into complacency.

It is a natural function of our mind to gravitate towards habits and to create an ego that likes an identity wrapped up in every object, person, and emotion that we come into contact with. However, we shouldn’t judge or be angry at these forces, they are as natural and unchangeable as the wind and tides. We should simply learn to work with them, and be constantly aware of all the sneaky attempts they make to overpower our awareness.

For me, the most difficult challenge is to remain in a state of vulnerability around those close to me. It is relatively easy for me to be honest with myself, and strangely easy for me to be honest with strangers, but I struggle to remain completely open around those that care about me the most. I have many excuses for why this is, but ultimately it is a powerful facet of my ego that wants to keep a strong identity with those I relate the most to.

There is a part of me right now that so badly wants to come up with another excuse. It wants to say that practice will help me overcome this, all I need to do is keep trying, that it’s a process. But that goes against what I realized in the car and what this post really is all about.

> What we fear most is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential. Imagine living in a world where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another — and love one another boldly because we know that to be human is to live with that fear.

The power to change our world is always within us. We only need to recognize and hold on to that knowledge in our most challenging moments to realize that it is true. Starting right now.

Wake up.
