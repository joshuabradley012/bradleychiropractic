Every second of every day we are faced with choices and decisions. Our lives and our health are a direct result of those decisions. Ultimately where we find ourselves at any point in time has largely been determined by the choices we have made. This can pertain to what we do for a living, where we live, relationships we have, and yes our state of health.

If you are currently facing a health crisis and want to do something to reverse it, one thing you must do is evaluate the choices you have made and are currently making. Some of the aspects of your life that must be evaluated are the choices you make concerning food, exercise, and the way you are thinking.

For some people having access to nourishing food is more difficult than it is for others, but most of the time even when our options are limited we can make healthier choices. For example, let’s say that you have no option except to eat at a fast food restaurant. You still have choices beginning with what restaurant.

Chipotle would be a much better choice than McDonalds. You don’t need to order a soda, you can choose water. Is dessert necessary?

The answer is, of course not.

When you go to the grocery store, you also have choices. Do you buy fresh fruits and vegetables along with healthy meats for protein, or do you buy frozen meals, snacks, ice cream, and sodas? If you are invited to a party, do you have to drink alcohol and eat the birthday cake?

One strategy is to substitute something healthy in place of the bad choice. Instead of the alcohol or soda, drink water. Most of us are dehydrated so choosing water over coffee, soda, and alcohol is a much better choice for your health. In every one of these situations we have a choice and if we begin making better choices, over time our health will improve.

How about exercise? This is something that is different for each person. Depending on age, overall level of fitness and current state of health your exercise requirements will vary.

If you are not exercising at all, it is important that you begin, but you need to make sure that you are doing exercise that is appropriate for where you currently are. Exercise is a vital part of a healthy lifestyle, but too much exercise can have an adverse effect on one’s health.

So if you are currently not exercising at all consult with a professional to determine what level of exercise is appropriate for you. Also, if you are currently exercising have a way to determine if your current routine is appropriate for you. Some people are either working out incorrectly or too intensely.

Once again it’s about choices. People who aren’t incorporating exercise into their daily routine love to make excuses, and believe me I’ve heard them all. In fact, I’ve probably used most of them myself.

“I don’t have enough time.” is probably the biggest excuse people use. Well, my answer to that is, “Can you get up 30 minutes earlier?” Most people can, it’s just a matter of deciding to do it.

Or another excuse I hear, “I’m so busy and by the time I get done with my day I just don’t have any more energy.” This is probably a person who has high stress levels and needs to keep their exercise level very easy. I would suggest that a person in this situation begin by taking a walk every evening for approximately 30 minutes and then do some light stretching or beginning yoga poses before going to bed.

The bottom line is that if you aren’t exercising and you know you should, it’s as simple as deciding to do so. That’s the first step, just make that first step and keep making small steps forward and before you know it you’ll be walking or exercising on a regular basis.

When it comes to our emotional health we also have choices. Most of us can choose to be around positive of negative people. If you can’t get away from negative people due to circumstances beyond your control what you can choose is how you react to their negativity.

Remember there isn’t any person or situation that can “make” you feel a certain way, you always have the choice as to how you react to circumstances around you. You and only you are in charge of how you choose to react or feel.

So, what we can focus on is what we surround ourselves with. What type of environment do you spend the majority of your life? Do you regularly watch or listen to news, which is by and large nothing but negativity. What type of people do you spend time with? Do they inspire you? Do they challenge you to become better? What kind of information or books do you read?

All of these things are largely within our control. We can choose to surround ourselves with love, joy, and positivity or we can choose fear, hate and negativity.

So take control of your health and start making positive choices. By realizing that you can make small changes in each aspect of your life my hope for you is that you will make choices that strengthen every aspect of your being. The choice is yours.
