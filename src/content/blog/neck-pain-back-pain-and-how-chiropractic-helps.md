Neck and back pain are almost always the result of imbalances in the body that usually come from poor posture, repetitive strenuous movement, obesity, or weak soft tissues (muscles, ligaments, and tendons) that can no longer support the spine. These imbalances may also come from a sudden trauma, such as whiplash. The only exceptions to this are diseases such as Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) that directly affect the spine and  are more difficult to treat.

Regarding the imbalances that are onset by lifestyle, imbalances begin when muscles begin to change in their relative tightness. Muscles that are not being strengthened begin to get long and weak, which puts strain on an opposing set of muscles that now have to work much harder and begin to get tight and short, worsening the imbalance. This muscular imbalance begins to pull the body out of alignment which results in pain.

With perfect posture the musculoskeletal system is in its optimal position to function and muscles have their proper length tension relationships. This means that nothing is spasmed, nothing is pinched, and no joints are stretched or compressed.

However when the body becomes imbalanced and out of alignment, the inverse is true. Facet joints are restricted or begin to degenerate, discs degenerate, muscles spasm, and nerves are pinched. Any combination of these factors could contribute to pain.

Even imbalances that are caused by a sudden trauma are characterized the same way. There will be a muscle that spasmed, and an opposing muscle that got stretched to allow the spine to be in a different position.

Most of the time, because of the way people eat, these imbalances are worsened by weak soft tissue. To have strong muscles, tendons, and ligaments, people have to eat a lot of quality proteins. Unfortunately most people don’t even get enough protein, let alone eat high quality proteins.  Having weak soft tissue lets injuries and imbalances occur more easily.

Also, without exercise, soft tissues will begin to degenerate and lose their strength. Combined with sitting in a couch or slumped in a chair for most of the day, poor posture is guaranteed. Poor posture is the reason for and result of muscular imbalances and eventually will lead to some sort of pain, or make you prepped for injury.

## How Does Chiropractic Help?

Chiropractic can help neck and back pain in many cases because an adjustment puts the misalignment back into position. This can release a spasmed muscle, relieve pressure on a pinched nerve, or realign the facet joints. For some people, an adjustment is all that is needed for their pain to go away.

Cases that are easy to correct are usually the result of trauma, or sudden misalignment, such as sleeping in the wrong position and tweaking your neck. However, in cases where it has taken months or even years for someone to develop a deep imbalance in their system it can be more difficult to correct.

Sometimes chiropractic alone isn’t enough to permanently correct a deep imbalance. The adjustment may make a patient feel good for a while, but then the pain will come back again. Admittedly it is good for business, but this is not the way I like to practice. The reason I became a chiropractor is to help people heal, so if I’m not getting people out of pain, I’m not doing my job.

To really help someone who has a deep imbalance I have to use a combination of techniques. I use heat therapy and electrical stimulation, recommend massage, teach a patient exercises and stretches they need, and recommend nutritional supplements to strengthen their soft and connective tissue.

Of course it is up to the patient to take action and make these changes, but I have found that when people are in pain they tend to listen. And when they see results they are always thankful that I was able to help them with all natural treatment.

## So What About Those Conditions that Are Harder to Help?

I mentioned that there are cases where the cause of pain is the result of some disorder or disease, which makes treatment more difficult.

In some cases, such as degenerative disc disease (DDD) which is commonly the result of aging, I can help. My spinal decompression table is an advanced technology that is an excellent treatment for such conditions.

Also, lifestyle choices and better nutrition can always help any condition by making the body healthier and more able to resist disease.

Unfortunately, there will be patients that I am unable to help because their condition is outside of the scope of my practice. In these instances I refer my patient’s out to other doctors and specialists that I trust and I know will be able to help.

Regardless, if you have any sort of neck pain, back pain or condition and are interested in seeing if chiropractic can help, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We will schedule you a consultation and see what we can do.
