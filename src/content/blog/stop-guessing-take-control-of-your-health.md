Well it’s finally here, our new website! I wanted to freshen up the business name so that it reflects more what our practice is all about. I also wanted to create a website that we have more control of so that we can use it as a tool to better communicate to the public and to our patient’s what we do and what we have to offer.

First a little background on me. I have been a practicing chiropractor for the past 19 almost 20 years now. Times have changed, and so have I. I don’t practice the same way that I did when I first started. I have grown and evolved, and continue to better myself by continually learning. I only bring this up so that you may better understand why I practice the way I do now.

You see first and foremost I am a chiropractor, which means I believe that the body has an amazing capacity to heal itself. As a chiropractor we learn how misalignments in the spine can cause pressure and imbalances in the nervous system leading to disease.

The pioneers of our profession had amazing results treating people with all sorts of health problems and seeing these people get their health back through chiropractic adjustments to the spine. When I first graduated school I was excited to heal all the people that I would come into contact with as a chiropractor.

Well, things didn’t work out quite as I’d expected. I soon realized that to help people truly heal in today’s world, chiropractic alone was not enough. I learned about what is known as the “triad of health” which states that health is achieved through balance of three sides of a triangle.

Each side represents a different aspect of our health. One side is a person’s structural alignment (chiropractic, exercise), another side is nutritional/chemical (diet and nutrition), and the last side is the mental/emotional/spiritual side. All three of these must be addressed and in balance with one another for a person to truly be able to be in a state of health.

To state this in practical easy to understand terms let’s say that a person exercises daily, gets regular chiropractic adjustments and is a positive, happy and well-adjusted person, but their diet is horrible. In fact let’s say this person lives on junk food, fast food, diet soda, caffeine and alcohol.

Will they be able to maintain optimal health? Or, will they begin to breakdown, degenerate and develop disease processes?

It doesn’t take a genius to realize that eventually with this type of diet, in spite of the exercise, chiropractic care and positive mental attitude, this type of person is a train wreck waiting to happen.

Or, let’s spin it another way. Take a person who eats perfectly, exercises regularly, has good structural alignment through chiropractic, but is the most negative, resentful, bitter, unforgiving person you’ve ever met. Will they be able to maintain optimal health?

Are you beginning to get the idea?

So, back to me being a young chiropractor. It didn’t take long for me to realize that all three of these sides of the triangle needed to be addressed in order for me to be able to help people heal themselves.

So, I began learning everything I could about diet and nutrition. I began to learn about proper exercise, exercise that was specific to a person’s needs and imbalances. I took numerous seminars and have read countless books and articles on the subjects of diet, nutrition, exercise and emotional/psychological well-being.

I’ve learned a lot from the likes of people like Paul Chek, Dr. John Brimhall, Dr. Van Merkle, and Reed Davis just to name a few. And now, I’ve put all of the pieces together so that I can effectively help my patient’s achieve the health they so desire.

For the past 8 years I have been a certified CHEK exercise coach and have a complete corrective exercise gym. We have been doing very detailed musculoskeletal evaluations to assess patient’s postural imbalances due to muscular weaknesses, muscle shortening and contraction. By doing these evaluations we are able to put people of exercise programs that are custom tailored to their needs and goals. Along with this I also became a Functional Diagnostic Nutritionist and now a certified Science Based Nutritionist.

This allows me to use laboratory tests to evaluate, blood, urine, hair and saliva to get an overall picture of what is going on with a person’s physiology and put them on a specific protocol of proper diet and nutrition. With these approaches we are able to be objective and measure with certainty where imbalances are in a person’s structure and nutrition, place them on specific protocols and then re-test to make sure changes are occurring.

It takes all of the guess work out and allows us to get real result that equate to real changes in health.

Most people would agree that exercise is a necessary part of a healthy lifestyle; sadly many people can’t seem to make it a habit. But, on the other hand there are a lot of people exercising on a regular basis but never really getting anywhere or believe it or not are actually damaging themselves.

Likewise most of us understand that we don’t get all of the nutrients we need from our standard diets and believe vitamins are required to fill in that void. So, they go to Costco, GNC, Walgreens or Walmart and buy what they think they need.

Herein lays the problem with these approaches and where I can offer a viable solution. With my approach every exercise you do has a reason behind it, from the choice of the exercises to the tempo, repetitions and sets, you know exactly what and how you should be exercising based on your individual needs.

Also, with our lab tests, we take the guesswork out of your nutritional needs and you know exactly what supplements you should be taking (including the dosages) and through re-testing you will know that they are actually changing your biochemistry and moving you towards a healthier you.

Take a look at our treatment options to see what we offer.

I am excited to help anyone with a health challenge, whether it is a serious condition or whether you just want to take your health to the next level. Call our office and schedule yourself for a consultation. Please be sure to let the staff know what it is you are interested in so that they can know what type of care you are interested in. I look forward to meeting with you and helping you.
