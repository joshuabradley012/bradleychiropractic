Eckhart Tolle talks about how sometimes the biggest egos are built up by the most self-effacing people. Whether this is done through a spiritual pursuit, renouncing worldly possessions, doing good deeds, meditating, studying, preaching, giving advice, or reading self-help books. If one does not place particular care in being aware of themselves, it can be very easy to fall into this trap.

Trust me, I find myself slipping into this “self-development” ego all the time.

While working towards a goal, it is easy to overvalue yourself. You become judgemental of others for not following a similar lifestyle, and become frustrated when people don’t want to talk about your revelation on the nature of reality. As a result you find yourself ignoring or dismissing what people say as being below you or for being overly egotistical. Which is terribly hypocritical for the supposed evolved person who is empathetic towards everyone and free of their ego.

It’s hypocritical in the worst way because layered on top of it is the denial that you are being hypocritical at all! You build an identity around being free from identity. Believing that all the things you do are absolutely for your higher self, you latch to and defend yourself most vehemently. Also believing that you are so evolved that there is no way you could have an ego, completely ignoring the glaringly obvious signs.

In the attempt to rid yourself from the ego it seems to latch on even harder.

However, in my experience there have been two simple pieces of wisdom I have had to remind myself of which seem to do a good job of re-centering myself and helping me become aware of my delusions. I think a core problem with this situation is overcomplicating the process. Thinking that to be evolved we need to do all these things, walk and talk this certain way, believe these progressive open beliefs, and so on. When in reality it’s a simple process to be more aware.

It’s also important to not think of the ego as an evil that needs to be rid from your mind, rather it is a natural function of the mind that has simply gotten out of hand for most of us. Let’s not let it continue to get out of hand in the process of honestly trying to be a better version of ourself.

## Don't Overcomplicate It

At any point in the process of self-development remember the golden rule: “be here now.” It’s such a simple piece of advice that it is easy to overlook and forget about, but it is one of the most powerful practices you can incorporate into your daily life. Taking time to breathe intentionally, quiet the mind, and take in the fullness of the moment is easy to do anywhere at any time and is one of the fastest ways to connect to the body instead of the mind.

This breathing technique, as described by Eckhart Tolle, is to “watch” a full breath from inhale to exhale feeling as it fills your body, giving that moment your full attention. In order to do it correctly, you must be aware of every nuance of the breath allowing it to completely fill your mind, stripping the ego’s hold over you for at least that moment. After taking the breath, take a moment to see the world around you without attachment. Forget what you “know” about the world and the labels you give it, just take it in for a moment and see how wondrous it can be.

In my personal experience, I also find it helpful to consider that your mind is not a separate thing from your body. Move the seat of your awareness out of your head and into the body, feeling it’s warmth and noticing any discomforts. But if that is getting to far ahead, simply watch your breath and try to be a little bit more in the moment for at least a second. Doing this sporadically through your day is a great habit to build and a great way to recognize when you are slipping away from presence.

I have to constantly remind myself that my measure of awareness isn’t about how articulately I can describe and think about the “truth” of reality, but how well I can balance the different aspects of myself and to carry that balance through my day. To do it is simple as long as you don’t let your ego get in the way and you don’t build an identity out of every one of your aspirations. Just breathe and be aware.

## The Ego is Necessary

The ego is a natural function of the mind, necessary to allow highly sensitive and intelligent creatures such ourselves to function at all.

This is something I have grappled with for some time because it can seem counterintuitive to the advice I’ve heard countless times of learning to control the ego and stop all thought. But I think it is a necessary, powerful, and more complete practice to consider the ego as an essential part of life.

In my view, the real goal of learning to still the mind is to have the power of choice. With an understanding of the ego and practice with being in presence, one can then choose when to be in their rational, forward looking ego mind and when instead to be in presence. Both are helpful for different situations, and with the right discipline, they can form a symbiotic relationship and help the other advance.

This is very different from eliminating the ego completely, which I believe is a nearly impossible goal.

The ego is important because regardless of how free of it you are, there are times in life where it will be necessary to think, to understand the separation of self and the outside world, and to give false form to a formless universe. Ernest Becker muses that a truly egoless human being would be a drooling pile of pure amazement, unable to filter the miraculous wonder of life into something that can be processed.

Also, even if after years of practice one learns to have a still mind and to act from an egoless place, if you want to communicate with others you will eventually have to distill your experience of pure consciousness into words that others can understand. Unless you decide to hold on to your experiences and wisdom for only yourself.

A practice that I have come up with myself to accept this fuller version of reality is to remind myself that full awareness is to let in “all of this.” Happiness, sadness, fear, presence, the ego, light, and dark are all irremovable pieces of reality. Holding on to the delusion that you will only have to experience pure bliss once you have mastered yourself and can filter the less savory experiences is exactly that, a delusion. And like most delusions it leads to false expectations and an impossible goal. It is more realistic to recognize that all things, good, bad, and indifferent, are parts of life that you will always experience.

Acceptance isn’t to accept only the things you like in life, acceptance is to let everything be a part of your life without judgement. To combine this with presence is to be fully aware of the multitude of experience that is in your life and to be fully there for all of it without getting to caught up in any of it.

To (try to) do this, I think to myself “It’s all of this, give in.” as a sort of mantra. I’ve used it in meditation, in yoga, and when I take a deep breath and am trying to be more aware. For me, it is simple and powerful, and makes me accept the fullness of reality and more willing to experience the negatives with as much openness as I experience the positives. If it doesn’t work for you then I invite you to find a nice reminder that does.

In particular, I use this to remind myself that everything, even the wicked ego, is part of life and I can’t block it out so I have to let it in.

## And So It Goes

Of course there is more to developing a true sense of presence without becoming an egomaniac than what I wrote here. There is also a lot of information out there of how to resolve your past, be stronger, healthier, more resilient, more connected, and so on. But while all that is important, being aware and accepting the ego are two key pieces that I find to be the most basic elements of a self development practice.

Because they’re so simple and self evident, I also find myself forgetting about them constantly. So I wrote this as a reminder to myself, and hopefully it’ll serve as a guide to others.

The deeper you go into such a practice the more insight you will have and the more wisdom you will gather. You will find many truths and each time you do the more important it becomes to remind yourself to not make an ego out of self development. It is difficult to realize the subjectivity of revelations that you thought were life changing, but it is essential for maintaining a true empathetic connection with others and where they are at. Again, a huge piece of this is not to overthink it and instead to live it.

So continue your practice, question everything, find the truths that work for you, and remember that nothing is undeniable fact.
