Recently I went to a presentation called “The Art and Science of Awe.” In brief, they presented new research on the physiological and social benefits of experiencing bouts of awe, the application of these new findings in schools, among veterans with PTSD, and in designing exhibits and cities. Mixed in were breaks of beautiful awe inspiring performances. I was floored by the presentation and I am so glad I got to experience the day put on by the Greater Good Science Center.

However, through the day I couldn’t help but think that they had missed something. Their application of awe revolved around bringing people into experiences that were intensely beautiful or were on such a cosmic scale that one had to recognize their relative insignificance in the world. River rafting was a common avenue for them to reach this, as well as hiking in Yosemite, or simply mindfully going outdoors and appreciating nature and our connection to it. Certainly, these are awe inducing experiences that are beneficial to anyone, by for us feel more connected to the world, and putting our problems into perspective. Compared to a rushing waterfall, our frustration over having to fill out some banal form seems appropriately trifle.

But in my opinion all of these methods of inducing awe are only focused on the external experience of awe. They miss the internal aspect of allowing oneself to be in awe.

Creating a society where awe is easier to access through activities or surroundings is undoubtedly a beautiful goal. It makes me hopeful for the future that there are intelligent people considering this seriously and recognizing how necessary it is that we change what we are currently doing. But again, it is not enough. There must be a balance of having external stimulus for awe, and having the internal allowance to experience it.

Speaking from experience, when one has a mindset that is closed or damaged enough it can be very difficult to experience anything positive, let alone awe. One’s favorite activities can become meaningless, beautiful locations can be ruined by mental noise and negativity, and awe inducing experiences can be reduced to annoying, anxiety riddled excursions.

Even if this isn’t the case and a river rafting type activity could bring someone out of that mindset for a moment and provide relief, it isn’t enough. There may even be carryover benefits for some time, as the research showed, but I imagine that eventually they would be back to the mental state they were in before they experienced awe. The simple experience of awe isn’t enough to shift one’s entire mindset and to give them an understanding and acceptance of self. (Of course they may be exceptions, there are always exceptions, but it is safe to say that this is rarely the case.)

Especially for someone in a desperate situation and can’t get out of their head during incredible experiences, it is more important that they do the inner work. Meaning instead seeking external experiences, they should work on finding the root of why they have difficulty experiencing awe. They should also be working on allowing themselves to feel awe in any part of their life in any situation.

Also, this is not a technique that only needs to be applied to those that are disadvantaged or damaged. Everyone can benefit from being awed more, more empathetic, and more aware.

This sort of growth comes from working internally. To recognize how the emotions and memories we hold on to paint our reality. Then to work on reducing the influence these things have in our life, and allowing ourselves live authentically.

There are many avenues to achieve this, but it is in essence self-therapy. Outsiders can facilitate the process, such as a therapist, a spiritual director, self-help books, and so on. But for it to fully work, one must become self-sufficient and apply these practices themselves. To always be reliant on others for our own peace and happiness means that we’ll always be a slave. But to give ourselves the freedom to remove our own biases and allow our happiness is the greatest freedom.

A school teacher from Queens, New York got the closest of any presenter to speaking and practicing the internalization of awe. She had her students record their awe inspiring from the week, creating positive feedback by experiencing and appreciating that moment again. I think this also had the effect of making them pay attention and seek moments in their week that awed them so they could later write about it. She also tried to teach them to experience awe in a setting as simple as the school yard.

This beautifully illustrates that life is wonderful enough in itself. With the right mindset, any moment can be filled with wonder and beauty. Though that may seem like a romantic ideal, I am sincere when I say this. There have been moments, only moments, where I have been in such a perceptive, egoless state of mind that the simple play of light in a room fills me with peace and gratitude for being able to experience the moment.

I remember one scene in particular when the sun glinted off the steel of my hammer while the rooftops and yards of the neighborhood spread beyond backed by the cloudless sky. From my vantage point of the roof I was struck by it’s beauty. All while nailing sheets of plywood to support beams. It didn’t take an outdoor adventure for me to feel that way, it didn’t even require an enjoyable experience. All that it took was awareness.

Raising awareness is at the root of this practice of letting awe in, as New Age-y as that may sound. Doing this personally, has given me moments of great insight and has allowed me fully to appreciate the moment. But again, I have had this only for moments. To constantly have the sort of awareness necessary to be in awe with the little things in life takes practice. More practice than I have yet to put in.

> Rather than being your thoughts and emotions, be the awareness behind them.

However, my personal favorite method of raising awareness in every day life is the one described by Eckhart Tolle in his superb books. That is simply to reconnect to the body through the breath. Take a moment to feel your body and your innate being in it. Remind yourself that you are not your thoughts, and you are not a slave to your ego, let go of thinking about the past and future, and place yourself in the now.

Become aware of your patterns. Pay attention to when you are triggered to anger. Find the thoughts you have been unconsciously repeating in your head for years and relieve them. Pay attention to how you feel when you act from a place of power, and when you act from a place of submission, feel where your emotions come from. Recognize when you are playing a role. And ask yourself to guess why these things might be.

It is important to not judge these things as good or bad. They are merely an assessment of what your state is at the moment. The important part is to be aware of them and recognize them as aspects of who you are, but not to confuse them for your true self. This awareness alone helps to let go and root yourself in the present moment, where you can be stunned by life’s beauty.

Keep in mind that this does not happen with the push of a button, it is a process that requires dedication and practice. However, in many ways this is a good thing. The lessons that we learn on our journey to better ourselves give us a better understanding of how to overcome personal challenges so we know how to face them when they invariably rise again. This understanding translates to increased empathy for those we can see going through the same struggles, and insight into how to help them overcome their challenges by sharing our experiences.

Another thing to consider is that our ego is in place for a reason. As Ernest Becker explains in his book “The Birth and Death of Meaning” it is quite possible that a sense of identity and the filtering of the world that comes along with it had an evolutionary advantage and is necessary for our survival. Otherwise we would be a drooling blob of ecstasy, unable to function in the face of the pure, ineffable, sensory overload that fully experiencing the world as a human would be. Our ego gives us a self-defense mechanism that allows us to operate individually from the world.

In the words of Kenneth Rexroth, “Man thrives where angels would die of ecstasy and pigs would die of disgust.”

Nevertheless, raising awareness to any degree is beneficial. Complete removal of the ego and acceptance of the moment may be possibly only for very few, and may even be undesirable to attain completely, but to work on accepting ourselves and living a life more full of awe is something for all of us to strive for.

So thank you again to the Greater Good Science Center for the incredible experience and education on the full range of benefits and applications of awe. But let us remember that awe is not only an external experience that we need to build around us, it is also an internal revelation as well that requires attention and practice to allow awe in everything.
