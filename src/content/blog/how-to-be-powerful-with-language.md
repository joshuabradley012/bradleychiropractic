Language is a powerful part of our world. On a personal level, we use it to share our thoughts and feeling, and on a global level, it is language that defines our policies, religions, and cultures. We use it every single day. But how many of us actually take the time to improve our native language? It comes so easily that soon we stop thinking about it. Other than learning the odd new word here and there we stop developing our ability with words.

This is limiting because as I will describe, words aren’t only how we communicate ourselves to others, they are also how we communicate with ourself. To continue growing as a person, it helps to have a strong grasp of language. Luckily there are also many things that one can do to continue developing their skill with all forms of communication, of which I’ll share my favorites with you.

## Why Language is Powerful

Symbolic language is what makes us human. Think about it. Without words you wouldn’t be able to plan for anything that isn’t immediately in front of you, you wouldn’t be able to hear the stories of your family and of your culture,  you wouldn’t even be able to call yourself by your own name. You wouldn’t have a concept of “I.”

But with words we are able to define the world. A ball is no longer just the image of a ball that you recall from memory, a ball can now be represented by a word that we all agree to mean ball. And we do this with every word that we use. The exact origins of language will perhaps always be unclear, although there are interesting theories, but certainly over thousands of years people began to create bodies of words that we call language.

By necessity, we teach this language to our children just as it was taught to us. From basic words we learn early in our life, we begin to build an internal world. By being able to represent the world in our head simply by recalling the word or by hearing it be said, we are able to experience a reality in our heads that is separate from the outside world. We can picture a ball and call it a ball without having to have a ball in front of us. In this internal world we begin to accumulate knowledge, build dreams, repeat memories, imagine worlds, and think ideas. We create a sense of self that is completely unique to us. We create our identity.

Not only do we get to define our own world and create our identity, but we get to share it accurately with others. We can form our thoughts, emotions, memories, experiences, and intuitions into concise packages that we send through the air into the ear and onto the mind of another human being. In a sense, communication is telepathy. You literally transpose an image from your mind to another’s.

For example, if I write for you to picture a pink elephant in your head, like magic, a pink elephant appears in your head. And I wrote this miles away from you, in the past, yet I can still put that image in your head. Imagine using this ability to share visions of God, create stories of our origin and destiny, and paint entirely imaginary worlds that are filled with indescribably beauty for others to enjoy.

That is the power of words. They give us a tool to share our vision of the world with others. We can create a future and describe our past. We create myths and legends, truths and lies, and share our loves and hates. Together, we create and live under a culture of the highest ideals, entities born from the minds of thinkers into the collective sphere of thought. Language shapes us and our world.

## The Choice to Use Language Effectively

You’ve probably seen a cute trick like this for before, like “You are now aware of your breathing.” or better yet “Try not thinking about the color yellow.”

Though simple mind tricks, they illustrate the power language has over us and over others. We have no choice but to imagine the things we hear. Others can put the images and ideas they choose in our minds, and we can do the same to others.

Because of this, we need to respect the people around us and choose to speak with care. That is not to say that we should hold back our true thought and not communicate our emotions, but certainly we can choose to communicate them in the most effective, honest way. Also, we can notice our patterns of creating negativity and when we speak from a defensive place, and with this awareness begin changing these habits.

Furthermore, when speaking from a place of influence, as a mentor, public presenter, or parent, we have the choice to be a source of inspiration or of fear. There is always the balance of keeping your vision realistic, but in most cases one can choose to say things that empower people to better themselves.

The other half of effectively using language is obvious but often overlooked, and that is listening. When listening to another person, we have the choice to give our fullest attention and listen openly. It is also within our power to observe how we react to others.

Do we constantly look for the next thing to say? Do we get frustrated by lengthy descriptions or differing opinions? Or do we listen with an open mind and open heart and recognize that they are speaking from where they are at and our reactions are completely within our control?

Listening can be especially difficult when we begin on a path of self-improvement. It’s strange, you would think that this should make listening easier, and it can when you are fully grounded and on the right path. But it is also easy to build this mindset that you only want to spend your time doing important things, that your path is higher than others. It become another ego. With this ego, other people become distractions, disturbances, you misunderstand them because you can’t see why they don’t see the world like you and can’t understand why they spend their time telling you these “meaningless” things.

Of course, this is a false perception. Someone who has truly bettered themselves would listen openly and honestly to anyone because everyone is deserving of respect and attention. No, they might not talk about the things that are on our mind, but they are speaking from there perspective and there is a world of things to learn from each person. Again, one must be careful to toe the line between listening with honest enthusiasm and being falsely enthusiastic. Of being willing to listen to anyone without subjecting yourself to toxicity or making people dependent on you. It is a difficult balance that I feel comes with time and practice, although I wouldn’t know because I’m not there yet.

A beautiful saying that I have used to better understand others is “As within, so without.”

It is useful for when one comes to you with complaints, negativity, hopelessness, or even mundane activities or opinions you might not agree with. If used successfully, it allows you to understand that the things they say are coming from their state of mind. The world they are showing you is but a glimpse of what is going on in their head. It is also not a representation of their true, highest self, but of their ego. Understanding people this way allows you to understand them, and potentially allows you to respond in a meaningful way whether that be poignant advice, or by simply being someone they can speak to without being judged.

It also helps in understanding one’s self because when I have a reaction of frustration, anger, pain, insecurity, or nervousness, I try to look at it with the perspective that this reaction is a result of my conditioning and of my current state, that these things aren’t truly me. I don’t ask “What is wrong with me?” I ask “What happened to me?” this way it becomes a useful tool for self-discovery and acceptance. Rather than looking at these things as an unchangeable character flaw, I look at them as the result of some unresolved experience that I can learn from and overcome. It reminds me that my spirit is always there, unchanged, unchangeable, and allowing me to be aware.

## Why Language is Powerful for Your Mind

Beyond communicating with others, having a strong grasp of language and by focusing on refining your language to be more inspirational, open, and positive, one has a powerful influence over their own reality. As I stated earlier, a beautiful saying to understand oneself is “As within, so without.”

If we are limited by the very foundation of our thoughts, if we do not have a way to articulate the serene and are constantly inundated by negative, violent media, how can we expect our thoughts to be any different?

Refining our language has the effect of refining our thoughts and refining how we communicate with ourself. Although there is no back and forth, at least not for most people, you express your idea, replay memories, plan your future, and dream all in your head. When we learn to be poignant and positive in our minds it reflects in our attitude and actions.

Though I believe that for one’s fullest development we should focus on lessening the control the mind has in our life and learn to be in equally in touch with our body and spirit as well, the mind is still a powerful aspect of anyone’s life. It is important to remember that the mind and the ego are not bad things, they are natural and unavoidable and shouldn’t be shut out. The problem is that we live in a society where the mind and the ego are considered self and it is inflated by everything in our modern culture, from consumer culture to the idea of the individual.

Regardless, the mind is an integral part of our life and it has to be worked on just as our diet and bodies have to be worked on. The patterns we use the most are easier for your mind to use again. This is both good and bad because it means negative thought patterns are difficult to break, but it also means that with practice, elevating your thoughts is possible.

One of the most powerful ways to do this is to use the same methods that you would use to refine your language and communications skills. Be open and honest. Don’t repress your true thoughts and emotions, but work on finding more positive ways to express them and understand that your mind isn’t you. It’s only a part of you. Just as your heart and it’s beat don’t fully define who you are, neither do your mind and it’s thoughts. Allow yourself to be an observer of your mind.

## How to Refine Language

Aside from begin aware of how you use your language and making the choice to be open, inquisitive, and inspirational in communication, there are excellent ways to refine your pure language abilities. Better yet, they are easy, accessible practices that you can incorporate into your daily routine.

Keep in mind that your goal shouldn’t be to write Shakespearian prose and to speak as eloquently as Dr. Martin Luther King, those goals are unrealistic for most, and are set so high that it becomes self-limiting. The goal here is to foster an attitude that you can improve your language and want to do it because it will help you be a more complete person.

There is no finish line and no landmark that says you are now an effective communicator, there is only constant refinement and honestly judging of how far you’ve come and where you can still improve. This is why writers, directors, and artists often continue their work well into old age, there is no end to this game. It is a long road that gets better as you go with no end in sight. Here are some tried and true methods to walk down that road.

### 1. Consume Better Media

The process of learning happens whether we choose to continue it or not. Our brain is wired to absorb information and incorporate it into its function. It is no wonder then, that when I find myself watching negative, fearful TV, playing meaningless, goal driven, addictive video games, and listening to soulless music, I begin to reflect it. I notice that I loose my grasp of my vocabulary and begin to think and speak with quick, impersonal statements often rooted in self-interest. It becomes difficult to write, difficult to think clearly, and even more difficult to have meaningful conversations with those close to me.

Don’t make my mistakes. Instead pick media that improves your mind and gives you joy. Also, I am very biased in my recommendations because this is how I see the world and I am particularly interested in the arts. But if you find reading dull and get true pleasure and insight from “Game of Thrones” go for it. The main point is to find media that you feel inspires you, gives you the chills, and gives you tools to be a better person.

If you currently consume media that is especially negative, it could be a good opportunity to ask yourself why. There may be someone out who honestly connects with and enjoys that on a spiritual level in a way that I personally can’t comprehend, but I feel in most cases consuming negative media is a sign of a negative outlook on life. This can be an opportunity to explore why you “enjoy” such things and resolve it.

However, it is also good to consider the 80/20 rule. If 80 percent of the time we are doing things to better ourselves, we can and should afford the other 20 percent to indulge in guilty pleasures to avoid burning yourself out with self-development. I find this to be another fine balance that easily pulls me towards distraction if I am not careful, but it is important to not feel guilty or judge yourself when you decide to unwind with something you know isn’t the best choice. Be aware of this choice, but allow yourself to enjoy that moment fully.

#### Literature

Books are excellent an choice because they make you slow down, clear your mind, and focus. Also, I find that if someone takes the time to write a book, they usually take the time to do it well. They use language you don’t hear when people speak, they discuss ideas at length, or they can paint stories in your head that let you be the director of your own film. I have found the most inspiration, insight, knowledge, beauty, grief, depth, and interest in books over all other forms of media.

Find a genre you like, find authors you like, but don’t be afraid to explore uncharted territory. I can’t tell you how many times I picked up a book randomly, or based on some loose recommendation by a friend and found myself intrigued. In any case, give reading a try and find books that you love. A good place to start is “The War of Art” it’s short, sweet, and absolutely inspirational.

Poetry is the purest expression writing, but in can be difficult or boring for many to read. However, I would sincerely encourage you to give poetry a try, it is a great example of effective, flexible language use. If you love poetry, I’ll assume you already know your favorites. but if you are looking to give it a try, I recommend starting with poets such as Rumi, T.S Eliot, and Emily Dickinson.

#### Music

Music is another excellent media to consume and pick good artists from. Find bands that you connect with who have songs that you feel you couldn’t live without. Again, be curious, be open, and allow yourself to explore. With the internet you can open yourself up to a world of music that is never played on the radio but is beautifully crafted by talented musicians. Spotify is my favorite tool to explore new music because they have almost every song you can imagine and give good suggestions based on your preferences.

Exploring classical music is a good option for those looking for something new. It is a different experience because you must listen closely to get the full effect of the music and to absorb the motivations behind the composition. However, classical this is free from the construct of words and allows music to give voice to the emotions that we can’t otherwise express. It is an incredible experience to connect to a song this way, here is a good place to start if you’ve never experienced music, a celebrated conductor will take you through really listening to music: Benjamin Zander, The Transformative Power of Classical Music.

#### Film and Videos

As far as movies, TV, internet videos, and documentaries go, there are the best and worst of both here. A masterfully created film can be one of the greatest achievements of art and can be an absolute marvel to watch. At the same time however, because video is the primary source of media for most people, there are many programs made only to absorb your attention and return no value. So many news stations, TV shows, and Youtube epitomize mindless consumption and should be very carefully monitored. Because it is very easy to get sucked into them, I find this happening to me often.

Good alternatives to the majority of mindless content is to find directors that create for art, documentaries about nature or about changing the world for the better, or Youtube channels that share messages of inspiration. They are out there in great abundance if we look for them. The documentary “I Am” is a great place to start.

#### Visual Arts

Painting, sculptures, and photography are other great sources of media. Visiting an art museum can be a wonderful opportunity to see the inspiration of artists and try to interpret the specific feelings behind their work. I personally have no serious education in art, but still love to go enjoy masterpieces and guess at what the artist was inspired by as they created. The internet is also a fantastic place to find such things if you don’t want to leave your seat (though I recommend you do) and you can find great collections of photographers works. One of my personal favorite collections are pictures of space.

Because of the largely exclusive culture of the arts that seeks only for “authentic” talent, it is hard to find art that isn’t highly respected in large art galleries. Though I don’t completely with the exclusivity of this, I do appreciate that others do most of the filtering for me. Even local, amateur art galleries can be wonderful to go to because the general culture still revolves around producing beautiful, inspired pieces of work. Though there often aren’t any words on pieces of art, they are attempts to communicate an emotion or moment that words cannot fully describe. Because of this, they can be effective sources of gaining a better control over language.

#### Dance, Sports, and Physical Games

Expressing yourself physically is a great way to develop your ability to communicate, as strange as that may sound. What it is really doing is fostering your connection with your body and giving yourself another channel of expression. I feel that these two things give you an overall better grasp of language.

Also, these things are an opportunity to have fun! Our lives are so often monotonous that giving our body an opportunity to move to color or to the needs of your team gives you a much needed reprieve.

Personally I know that I need to dance more because I almost never do and it is such a integral part of being human. But I proudly exercise every day and enjoy finding opportunities to play a sport or come up with a game with friends that makes us move and coordinate.

#### Video Games

And finally, I feel video games should be mentioned because they have become a major part of entertainment. There are people exploring the potential social benefit of video games, such [Jane McGonigal](//www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en). I agree that in certain situations video games can actually be a way for people to connect and explore spaces. Though they may be “virtual” spaces, all the experiences are still in reality, so the connections that people feel in these spaces can be very real.

However, I personally find that I have to avoid most video games because they are very addictive for me. I feel a pressure in my head when I play them that becomes obsessed with the goal-achieving objectives that I can’t stop thinking about and can’t stop chasing. In most cases I find that there are much more productive, expressive things I could do with my time than play video games. Also, I find most video games to be rooted in expressing the things that we repress in real life. Grand Theft Auto is a perfect example of this, even though it is one of my personal favorite games, and games that allow you to live in a perfect world that present just enough of a challenge while ultimately being totally beatable give a sense of control and success that people often lack in real life. Again, there many benefits that might potentially come from this, such as relenting repressed emotions, but there is also huge potential to make this an unconscious escape from reality.

I have no recommendations for inspiring video games, because I have not found one and try to avoid games. But I’ll leave the verdict of whether they can be used productively or not up to you.

#### Do It Yourself

Finding a creative outlet is one of the most rewarding past times to have. Learning to play an instrument, singing, designing, painting, dancing, recording home videos, and writing your own stories is a fantastic way to develop yourself. It is fulfilling to create something you are proud of, and it is a transcendent experience to feel that you are allowing something to flow through you during the creative process. Allowing your spirit (or subconscious, or muse, or however you interpret it) to take full reign of your body and mind and to have a piece of art flow through you reminds you that you are more than your ego and develops your connection with your Self.

Allowing yourself to connect with a flow state is also extremely beneficial in learning how to communicate more effectively. You learn to speak from the heart in unique excited ways. Jason Silva is a great example of what happens when you allow yourself to be in a full state ot flow then communicating with others.

### 2. Surround Yourself With Effective Communicators

They say that we are a product of the five people we spend the most time with. So if we spend time with people that are close minded, negative, fearful, uninspired, and so on, the chances are that we will absorb some of these tendencies and act them out in our own life.

I am not saying to cut everyone that isn’t perfect out of your life, but I am saying that the core group of people that we spend time with should be carefully found. People that inspire you, drive you, support you, and help you become a stronger person are rare gifts. But finding them can have a huge impact on your life. And when your core group of people are an inspiring bunch, you can afford to spend time with more lethargic people who you still care about an want to see succeed, without being drained and overly influenced.

Occasionally, yes it is necessary to cut a bad influence out of our lives, but for the most part people are negative not because they hate others, but because it is a reflection of what their relationship with self is. Showing these people empathy and being an source of honest and non-judgement can be just as big for them it is for you to spend time with inspiring people.

This is perhaps the most difficult step because it relies on being social and finding others. Personally I have struggled with this a lot. But there is a huge payoff to finding such people and putting out in the world that you are looking to improve yourself.

### 3. Write It Down

Writing is one of the best practices to develop your language skills. Much of what you learn by crafting clear, cohesive sentences transfers over to how you speak. You learn to better express yourself and to be a better storyteller. You practice focusing on one idea for long enough to take it to its end and how to branch off of one idea and not stop cold once you’ve described something. It enhances your associational thinking and your ability to hold multiple ideas in your head as you explore one. The biggest advantage I have received from writing consistently is developing a larger, more vibrant vocabulary.

It is one thing to know a word, but it is another to know its various connotations and when to use it for the most impact. Writing provides a safe place to practice using words you are not completely comfortable because you can take the time to look up the definition, or explore synonyms to describe the thing exactly as you want to. Once you build confidence using larger, more obscure, more descriptive words in your writing it becomes much easier to incorporate them into your everyday speech.

The final benefit of writing that I’ll talk about is it’s capacity for expressing emotions and putting them in a lasting format. For those of us who find it difficult to speak our mind at times, it can be much easier to write these things down and share them in the form of a letter. Also, creating beautiful letters of honesty or appreciation create lasting mementoes of those moments that either you or your loved one can return to. I feel in a world where messages and social media posts are quickly forgotten, the lasting nature of these things can give much needed sentimental meaning, and a reference point to look back on one day.

### 4. Speak It Out

Now it’s time to put it all to it’s most direct use, speaking. When speaking with people, practice being eloquent in your thoughts, while staying open, honest, non-judgemental, and keep listening! It becomes easy to develop a big head when you become good at speaking your mind, but it is important to remember that the real dance and art of communication is listening and responding in a meaningful way. You can practice speaking this way with the people you are the most comfortable with. Tell your loved ones something you’ve always wanted to say or some new idea, observation, or path that you would have never shared before. This is where that group of close friend who are effective communicators comes in handy, they will be the perfect springboard to feel confident with and continue to improve with.

Another place to develop your speaking skills are practicing from a place of influence. When someone comes to you for advice, or as a confident, or when you are speaking to people who look up to you, practice being inspirational. Again, be realistic, but find a way to share a vision of the world that promotes positivity and action. We need more of this in the world.

Or, to reach an audience of this sort, take a public speaking class or begin presenting at local conventions. Another avenue for something like this is online videos or a podcast. While this path isn’t for everyone, remember that there are many opportunities to speak to an audience if you feel that is something you want to do. It also drives you to be your best self so you can give the most honest presentation that you can. Advice from everyone who as ever done this though, your first try will be terrible, and that’s okay. What’s more important is starting if this is something you dream about.

And if you do not reach out to a wider audience, being an effective communicator with the people in your immediate circle. One of the more difficult but rewarding things to try is to have conversations that aren’t the expected cultural norms. Instead of commenting on the weather, comment on how you feel dreams are an essential part of human life. Pay attention to when you say things that you know how people are going to respond, and decide to take a risk instead. Ask the things that you don’t know the response to. People often are just as excited and desperate to have a real conversation as you are.

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice

Developing your skills with language never stops. There is never a point that you reach where you can look around and say “I did it, I can express everything perfectly.”

But you can constantly refine your ability to describe the world, break paradigms, listen deeply, and put your unique voice out into the world. Getting our of your head and expressing yourself from the spirit is a long, rewarding process that you must facilitate if you hope of ever achieving. And I fully believe that these tools that I have presented to you can help you reach that end, if you practice them consistently and effectively.

They have certainly helped me, and when I listen to my own advice the make me grow a lot as a person. It is easy to fall off the wagon and go back to using sloppy, mundane, unconscious language in your life. But I feel that with practice, each time you fall down, you land a little more softly and can keep bouncing back up. To do this, you just need to keep practicing every single day and be aware of what you do that you can improve on.

Draw inspiration from others who you can tell have followed a similar path, pick up on how the best of the best express themselves, and strive to be that way too. Having powerful language abilities changes your relationship with others, with the world, and with yourself.
